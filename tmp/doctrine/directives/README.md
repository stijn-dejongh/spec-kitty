## Purpose

Directives are explicit instructions and constraints for agent behavior. Each directive is numbered (001-039+) for load-on-demand efficiency and prescribes what must or must not be done in specific situations.

## Reserved Numbers

The following directive numbers are **reserved for future use**:

| Code | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 027  | Reserved | Number gap in sequence |
| 029  | Reserved | Number gap in sequence |
| 030  | Reserved | Number gap in sequence |
| 031  | Reserved | Number gap in sequence |
| 032  | Reserved | Number gap in sequence |
| 033  | Reserved | Number gap in sequence |

**Rationale:** These numbers were skipped during framework evolution, likely due to removed or unimplemented directives. They are reserved to maintain numerical stability and avoid confusion.

**Policy:** Do not reuse these numbers unless formally deprecating and replacing an existing directive.

## Usage Patterns

### Loading Directives

Directives are loaded on-demand using the pattern:

```
/require-directive 001
/require-directive 014
```

### Directive Precedence

Per DOCTRINE_STACK.md:
1. **Guidelines** override all other layers (highest precedence)
2. **Directives** override Tactics and Templates
3. **Approaches** provide rationale but don't override directives
4. **Tactics** are invoked by directives (procedural execution)
5. **Templates** shape directive outputs (lowest precedence)

### Creating New Directives

When adding a new directive:

1. **Choose next available number** in sequence (036+)
2. **Follow naming convention:** `XXX_descriptive_name.md`
3. **Include required sections:**
   - Purpose statement
   - Scope and context
   - Explicit instructions or constraints
   - Related directives/approaches/tactics
4. **Update this index** with new entry
5. **Cross-reference** from relevant agent profiles
