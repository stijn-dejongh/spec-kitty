# Tactic: <Name>

## Intent
Describe **what problem this tactic solves** and **when it should be applied**.

Keep this short and concrete.
Do not explain *how* to do the work here.
Avoid justification or persuasion.

Good intent statements answer:
- In what situation is this tactic appropriate?
- What kind of outcome does it enable or protect?

---

## Preconditions
State **what must be true before this tactic is executed**.

Include:
- required inputs or artifacts
- assumed context (team, system, phase)
- explicit exclusions (when *not* to use this tactic)

If a precondition is violated, this tactic should not be run.

**Reference Localization:**
- References to other documents should be localized (no external websites)
- Only link to documents within the core doctrine stack directives
- Do NOT link to `work/`, `temp/`, `.claude/`, or other non-core directories
- These directories are not distributed/bundled/canonically stable
- Use relative links for internal references (e.g., `[Directive 017](../directives/017_test_driven_development.md)`)

---

## Execution Steps
Define the **exact sequence of actions** required to perform the tactic.

Guidelines:
- Use a numbered list.
- Steps should be linear and unambiguous.
- Avoid branching unless absolutely necessary.
- Do not include rationale or advice.
- If judgment is required, name it explicitly.

Each step should be executable without interpretation.

---

## Checks / Exit Criteria
Describe **how to determine that the tactic is complete**.

Include:
- conditions that must be satisfied
- artifacts that must exist
- validations that must pass

Exit criteria should be observable and verifiable.

---

## Failure Modes
List **common ways this tactic can go wrong or be misapplied**.

Include:
- misuse due to wrong context
- typical shortcuts or omissions
- behaviors that undermine the intent

This section exists to prevent silent failure.

---

## Outputs
Specify the **concrete artifacts produced by this tactic**.

Examples:
- documents
- code changes
- test cases
- analysis results
- summaries or reports

Outputs should be explicit enough to integrate with templates or downstream tactics.

---

## Notes (Optional)
Add **practical clarifications or usage notes** that do not fit elsewhere.

Use this section sparingly.
Do not restate execution steps or intent.
Avoid turning this into a tutorial or guideline.
