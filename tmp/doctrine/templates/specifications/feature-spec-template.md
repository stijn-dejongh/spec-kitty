## Notes for Authors

**When filling out this template:**

1. **Start with User Story** - Write from persona perspective first
2. **Use MoSCoW prioritization** - Be honest about MUST vs SHOULD vs COULD
3. **Keep it functional** - Describe WHAT, not HOW
4. **Write testable scenarios** - Every Given/When/Then should be verifiable
5. **Link to personas** - Understand who needs this and why
6. **Reference ADRs** - Don't duplicate architectural decisions
7. **Mark open questions** - Be explicit about unknowns
8. **Update as you learn** - Living document during development
9. **Freeze when implemented** - Mark as Implemented when feature is done
10. **Get approval** - Don't skip stakeholder review

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- ❌ Dictating implementation (code structure, libraries, file organization)
- ❌ Duplicating ADR content (architectural trade-offs belong in ADRs)
- ❌ Forgetting personas (always identify who needs this)
- ❌ Vague requirements (be specific and testable)
- ❌ Missing edge cases (think about error conditions and limits)

**Good specification example:**
> **FR-M1:** System MUST display task status updates within 500ms of file change
> - **Rationale:** Software Engineers need real-time feedback to monitor agents
> - **Personas Affected:** Software Engineer, Agentic Framework Core Team
> - **Success Criteria:** WebSocket event delivered <500ms (95th percentile)

**Bad specification example:**
> ❌ Create a FileWatcher class using watchdog library with debounce=100ms
> ❌ Store connections in dict keyed by session ID
> ❌ Use Flask-SocketIO for WebSocket handling
