# Tactics: Procedural Execution Guides

Tactics are step-by-step procedures for executing specific activities within the agentic development framework. They provide concrete, ordered instructions that agents can follow to accomplish well-defined objectives.

**Location:** `tactics/`  
**Purpose:** Procedural execution (the "how")  
**Invoked by:** Directives (explicit) or discoverable exploration (with Human approval)

---

## What Tactics Are

Tactics sit in the **fourth layer** of the doctrine stack, between Directives (which select what to do) and Templates (which define output shape).

**Characteristics:**
- **Procedural:** Step-by-step instructions, not advisory guidance
- **Bounded:** Clear preconditions, execution steps, and exit criteria
- **Verifiable:** Concrete outputs and measurable completion signals
- **Failure-aware:** Explicit failure modes to prevent silent errors

**Not Tactics:**
- Philosophical frameworks (those are Approaches)
- Compliance rules (those are Directives)
- Output formats (those are Templates)
- Strategic guidance (those are Guidelines)

---

## How to Use Tactics

### Directive-Driven Invocation (Primary Path)

When a Directive explicitly references a tactic:

1. Directive mandates tactic invocation at specific workflow step
2. Agent loads tactic file and follows execution steps
3. Agent documents tactic invocation and results in work log
4. Agent proceeds with workflow

**Example:**
```markdown
## Directive 018 (Traceable Decisions)

When creating an ADR for a high-risk decision:
- Invoke tactic: `./premortem-risk-identification.tactic.md`
- Document failure scenarios in ADR "Risks" section
```

### Exploratory Discovery (Secondary Path)

When context suggests a tactic might apply but no Directive mandates it:

1. Agent searches this README for relevant tactic
2. Agent proposes tactic to Human with rationale
3. Human approves or rejects invocation
4. If approved, agent loads tactic and follows execution steps
5. Agent documents approval and results in work log
