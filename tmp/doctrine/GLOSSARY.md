- **Authority:** Power to make significant decisions and interventions
- **Control:** Ability to halt, redirect, or override agent operations
- **Ownership:** Ultimate arbiter of quality, direction, and delivery

## Usage Guidelines

### For Agents

- Reference glossary terms when explaining decisions or documenting work
- Use consistent terminology across all artifacts and communications
- When encountering ambiguous terms, consult this glossary first
- Suggest new terms or clarifications via work logs when gaps are identified

### For Humans

- Use glossary terms when providing instructions to agents
- Reference specific terms when clarity is needed
- Propose term additions or refinements through pull requests
- Review glossary during agent framework onboarding

### Cross-Referencing

When directives or agent profiles reference glossary terms, use this format:

```markdown
See [Term Name](./GLOSSARY.md#term-name) for definition.
```

## Maintenance

This glossary is a living document. Updates follow Version Governance (Directive 006):

- **Minor updates** (clarifications, examples): Update version patch number
- **New terms** (additions): Update version minor number
- **Structural changes** (reorganization): Update version major number

All changes require review by Curator agent for consistency and alignment with existing framework documentation.

**Maintained by:** Curator Claire  
**Review cycle:** Quarterly or when 5+ new terms are identified  
**Change requests:** Submit via ${WORKSPACE_ROOT}/collaboration/inbox/ task file
