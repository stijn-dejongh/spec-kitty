# Approaches

This directory contains an overview of agentic approaches. These are descriptions of step-by-step guides, to be used as a reference by agents to simplify their task execution.

**Goal:** Reduce reasoning complexity and search-space by collecting task-specific operational approaches here.

## Available Approaches

## Usage

Agents should reference approaches when:

- Executing tasks that match a documented pattern
- Learning operational workflows
- Needing step-by-step guidance for complex coordination

Load approach content as context when applicable to reduce reasoning overhead and ensure consistency.
