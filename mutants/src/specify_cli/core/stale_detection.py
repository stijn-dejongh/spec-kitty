"""
Stale Work Package Detection
============================

Detects work packages that are in "doing" lane but have no recent VCS activity,
indicating the agent may have stopped without transitioning the WP.

Uses git/jj commit timestamps as a "heartbeat" - if no commits for a threshold
period, the WP is considered stale.
