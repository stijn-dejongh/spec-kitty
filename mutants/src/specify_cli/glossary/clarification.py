"""Interactive clarification middleware (WP06, WP08).

This module implements the ClarificationMiddleware that handles interactive
conflict resolution. It emits 3 event types at its boundaries:

- GlossaryClarificationRequested: when user defers a conflict
- GlossaryClarificationResolved: when user selects a candidate sense
- GlossarySenseUpdated: when user provides a custom sense definition

Pipeline position: Layer 4 (after extraction, semantic check, and gate)

    When conflicts are detected and generation is not blocked (or after
    the user resolves a blocking conflict), this middleware handles:

    1. Presenting conflicts to the user for resolution
    2. Accepting user's choice: select a candidate sense OR provide custom
    3. Emitting appropriate events for each resolution action
    4. Updating the execution context with resolved senses

    Usage:
