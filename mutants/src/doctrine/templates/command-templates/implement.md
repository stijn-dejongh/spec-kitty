# /spec-kitty.implement - Create Workspace for Work Package

**Version**: 0.11.0+
**Purpose**: Create an isolated workspace (git worktree) for implementing a specific work package.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Working Directory Requirement

**After running `spec-kitty implement WP##`, you MUST:**

1. **Run the cd command shown in the output** - e.g., `cd .worktrees/###-feature-WP##/`
2. **ALL file operations happen in this directory** - Read, Write, Edit tools must target files in the workspace
3. **NEVER write deliverable files to the main repository** - This is a critical workflow error

**Why this matters:**

- Each WP has an isolated worktree with its own branch
- Changes in main repository will NOT be seen by reviewers looking at the WP worktree
- Writing to main instead of the workspace causes review failures and merge conflicts

**Verify you're in the right directory:**

```bash
pwd
# Should show: /path/to/repo/.worktrees/###-feature-WP##/
```

**Deterministic pre-read checks (required before Read/Edit/Write tools):**
```bash
ls -la
test -f kitty-specs/<feature>/tasks/<wp-file>.md && echo "wp prompt exists"
```
If a path is uncertain, verify with `ls` or `test -f` first.

## CRITICAL: This is a TWO-STEP Command

**Step 1**: Get the WP prompt and implementation instructions

```bash
spec-kitty agent workflow implement WP## --agent __AGENT__
```

This displays the full WP prompt with detailed requirements and shows:

```
WHEN YOU'RE DONE:
================================================================================
✓ Implementation complete and tested:
  spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP## --to for_review --note "Ready for review"
```

**Step 2**: Create the workspace (if needed) and implement according to the prompt

```bash
spec-kitty implement WP##              # No dependencies (branches from main)
spec-kitty implement WP## --base WPXX  # With dependencies (branches from base WP)
```

## Completion Requirements

**Your work is NOT complete until**:

1. ✅ All subtasks in WP prompt are finished
2. ✅ All tests pass (if required)
3. ✅ Changes committed to the WP workspace
4. ✅ **WP moved to for_review lane**: `spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP## --to for_review --note "Ready for review"`

**The WP file location determines status**:

- In `tasks/WP##-*.md` with `lane: "doing"` = IN PROGRESS (not done)
- Need to move to `for_review` lane when complete

## When to Use

After `/spec-kitty.tasks` generates work packages in the main repository:

- Planning artifacts (spec, plan, tasks) are already in main
- Run `spec-kitty agent workflow implement WP01 --agent __AGENT__` to get the full prompt
- Run `spec-kitty implement WP01` to create a workspace for the first WP
- Run `spec-kitty implement WP02 --base WP01` if WP02 depends on WP01
- Each WP gets its own isolated worktree in `.worktrees/###-feature-WP##/`

## Workflow

**Planning Phase** (main repo, no worktrees):

```
/spec-kitty.specify → Creates spec.md in main
/spec-kitty.plan → Creates plan.md in main
/spec-kitty.tasks → Creates tasks/*.md in main
```

**Implementation Phase** (creates worktrees on-demand):

```
spec-kitty implement WP01 → Creates .worktrees/###-feature-WP01/
spec-kitty implement WP02 --base WP01 → Creates .worktrees/###-feature-WP02/
```

## Examples

**Independent WP** (no dependencies):

```bash
spec-kitty implement WP01
# Creates: .worktrees/010-workspace-per-wp-WP01/
# Branches from: main
# Contains: Planning artifacts (spec, plan, tasks)
```

**Dependent WP**:

```bash
spec-kitty implement WP02 --base WP01
# Creates: .worktrees/010-workspace-per-wp-WP02/
# Branches from: 010-workspace-per-wp-WP01 branch
# Contains: Planning artifacts + WP01's code changes
```

## Validation

The command validates:

- Base workspace exists (if --base specified)
- Suggests --base if WP has dependencies in frontmatter
- Errors if trying to branch from a non-existent base

## Parallel Development

Multiple agents can implement different WPs simultaneously:

```bash
# Agent A
spec-kitty implement WP01

# Agent B (in parallel)
spec-kitty implement WP03

# Both work in isolated worktrees without conflicts
```

## Dependencies

Work package dependencies are declared in frontmatter:

```yaml
dependencies: ["WP01"]  # This WP depends on WP01
```

The implement command reads this field and validates the --base flag matches.

## Complete Implementation Workflow

**ALWAYS follow this sequence**:

```bash
# 1. Get the full WP prompt and instructions
spec-kitty agent workflow implement WP## --agent __AGENT__

# 2. Read the "WHEN YOU'RE DONE" section at the top of the prompt
# It will show exactly what command to run when complete:
#   spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP## --to for_review --note "..."

# 3. Create workspace (if not exists)
spec-kitty implement WP##              # Or with --base if dependencies

# 4. Navigate to workspace
cd .worktrees/###-feature-WP##/

# 5. Implement according to WP prompt
# ... write code, run tests, commit changes ...

# 6. Move to for_review (REQUIRED - not optional!)
spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP## --to for_review --note "Ready for review"
```

**IMPORTANT**: Step 6 is MANDATORY. The WP is NOT complete until moved to `for_review` lane.

## Lane Status

Work packages move through lanes:

- `planned` → Initial state after `/spec-kitty.tasks`
- `doing` → Agent is implementing (automatically set by workflow command)
- `for_review` → Implementation complete, waiting for review ← **YOU MUST MOVE HERE**
- `done` → Review passed, WP complete

**Check current lane**:

```bash
grep "^lane:" kitty-specs/###-feature/tasks/WP##-*.md
```

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "Base workspace WP01 does not exist"**

- Solution: Implement WP01 first: `spec-kitty implement WP01`

**Error: "WP02 has dependencies. Use: spec-kitty implement WP02 --base WP01"**

- Solution: Add --base flag as suggested

**Warning: "Base branch has changed. Consider rebasing..."**

- Solution: Run suggested rebase command

**"I finished implementing but nothing happened"**

- Check: Did you move to for_review? `spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP## --to for_review`
- The WP file must be moved to for_review lane for the workflow to continue

**"Status board shows 'doing' but I just moved to 'for_review'"**

- This is normal! Status is tracked in the target branch. A reviewer may have already moved it back to "doing" (changes requested), or there's a sync delay. Don't panic - focus on your WP.
