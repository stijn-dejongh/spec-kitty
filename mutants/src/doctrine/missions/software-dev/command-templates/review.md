description: Perform structured code review and kanban transitions for completed task prompt files

## Constitution Context Bootstrap (required)

Before running workflow review, load constitution context for this action:

```bash
spec-kitty constitution context --action review --json
```

Use JSON `text` as governance context. On first load (`mode=bootstrap`), follow referenced docs as needed.

**IMPORTANT**: After running the command below, you'll see a LONG work package prompt (~1000+ lines).

**You MUST scroll to the BOTTOM** to see the completion commands!

Run this command to get the work package prompt and review instructions:

```bash
spec-kitty agent workflow review $ARGUMENTS --agent <your-name>
```

**CRITICAL**: You MUST provide `--agent <your-name>` to track who is reviewing!

If no WP ID is provided, it will automatically find the first work package with `lane: "for_review"` and move it to "doing" for you.

## Dependency checks (required)

- dependency_check: If the WP frontmatter lists `dependencies`, confirm each dependency WP is merged to main before you review this WP.
- dependent_check: Identify any WPs that list this WP as a dependency and note their current lanes.
- rebase_warning: If you request changes AND any dependents exist, warn those agents to rebase and provide a concrete command (example: `cd .worktrees/FEATURE-WP02 && git rebase FEATURE-WP01`).
- verify_instruction: Confirm dependency declarations match actual code coupling (imports, shared modules, API contracts).

**After reviewing, scroll to the bottom and run ONE of these commands**:

- ✅ Approve: `spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP## --to done --note "Review passed: <summary>"`
- ❌ Reject: Write feedback to the temp file path shown in the prompt, then run `spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP## --to planned --review-feedback-file <temp-file-path>`

**The prompt will provide a unique temp file path for feedback - use that exact path to avoid conflicts with other agents!**

**The Python script handles all file updates automatically - no manual editing required!**

## Telemetry (final step)

After completing the review and running the move-task command, emit a telemetry event to record this review phase:

```bash
spec-kitty agent telemetry emit \
  --feature <feature-slug> \
  --role reviewer \
  --wp-id <WP-ID> \
  --agent <your-agent-name> \
  --model <your-model-id>
```

Note: Include `--wp-id` to associate this review event with the specific work package. The `move-task` command also emits a telemetry event — this is intentional (captures both the task transition and the review phase completion).

Include `--input-tokens`, `--output-tokens`, `--cost-usd`, `--duration-ms` if available. This is fire-and-forget — failures never block the workflow.
