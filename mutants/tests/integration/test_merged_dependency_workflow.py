"""Integration tests for implementing WPs after dependencies are merged (ADR-18).

Simulates real workflow:
1. Implement WP01
2. Merge WP01 to target branch (2.x)
3. Clean up WP01 workspace (per ADR-9)
4. Implement WP02 (depends on WP01)
   - Should branch from 2.x (contains WP01's changes)

This validates the fix in ADR-18 (Auto-Detect Merged Single-Parent Dependencies).
