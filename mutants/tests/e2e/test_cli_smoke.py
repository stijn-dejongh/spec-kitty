"""End-to-end CLI smoke test for the full spec-kitty workflow.

Exercises the complete sequence:
  create-feature -> setup-plan -> finalize-tasks -> implement -> move-task

This test creates a fresh temporary git repo, runs each CLI command via
subprocess, and verifies that intermediate artifacts exist at each step.
It is entirely self-contained: no state leaks to the source repository.

Marked with pytest.mark.e2e for optional CI separation:
    pytest tests/ -m "not e2e"    # skip E2E in fast runs
    pytest tests/e2e/ -v -s       # run E2E only
