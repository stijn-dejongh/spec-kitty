# Calibration Report: erp-custom

**Mission**: erp-custom (ERP Integration custom mission)  
**Date**: 2026-04-27  
**Overlay**: `.kittify/doctrine/overlays/calibration-erp-custom.yaml`  
**Fixture**: `tests/fixtures/missions/erp-integration/mission.yaml`  
**Status**: No edge changes required — all steps pass §4.5.1

---

## Summary

All 7 steps of the ERP Integration custom mission pass the §4.5.1 inequality. The ERP mission reuses built-in action URNs (`action:research/gathering`, `action:software-dev/implement`, `action:software-dev/specify`, `action:software-dev/retrospect`) — the shipped graph satisfies all requirements. Transitive extras are classified as `known_irrelevant`.

## Action Mapping

| ERP step | Mapped action URN | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| query-erp | `action:research/gathering` | Pulls data from ERP endpoint |
| lookup-provider | `action:research/gathering` | Looks up matching provider record |
| ask-user | `action:software-dev/specify` | Operator confirms export shape |
| create-js | `action:software-dev/implement` | Generates JS adapter |
| refactor-function | `action:software-dev/implement` | Refactors legacy function |
| write-report | `action:research/gathering` | Summarizes the run |
| retrospective | `action:software-dev/retrospect` | Mission retrospective marker |
