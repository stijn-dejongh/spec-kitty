# Vendor spec-kitty-events Library Instead of External PyPI Dependency

**Filename:** `2026-01-31-1-vendor-spec-kitty-events.md`

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2026-01-31

**Deciders:** Robert Douglass, Claude Sonnet 4.5

**Technical Story:** 0.13.20 release blocked by PyPI rejecting direct Git dependencies

---

## Context and Problem Statement

During the 0.13.20 release, PyPI rejected the package upload because `spec-kitty-events` was specified as a direct Git dependency:

```toml
"spec-kitty-events @ git+ssh://git@github.com/Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty-events.git@fc332dda..."
```

PyPI's policy prohibits direct Git dependencies because:
- They cannot be resolved reliably by pip
- They may point to private repositories
- They lack proper semantic versioning
- They bypass PyPI's security and trust mechanisms

This blocked the release process, requiring an immediate decision on how to handle the `spec-kitty-events` dependency.

## Decision Drivers

* **Release urgency**: 0.13.20 needs to ship immediately with ADR-18 fixes
* **Package complexity**: Maintaining two separate PyPI packages adds overhead
* **Distribution simplicity**: Users prefer single `pip install` command
* **Future extensibility**: Events library will be used extensively in future features
* **Development workflow**: Events code is tightly coupled to spec-kitty internals
* **PyPI policy compliance**: Must eliminate Git dependencies to publish

## Considered Options

1. **Publish spec-kitty-events as separate PyPI package**
2. **Vendor spec-kitty-events into spec-kitty** (CHOSEN)
3. **Make spec-kitty-events an optional dependency**

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** "Vendor spec-kitty-events into spec-kitty", because it provides the simplest distribution model, eliminates the need to maintain two PyPI packages, and ensures all users get the events functionality without extra installation steps.

### Implementation

- Copied `spec-kitty-events/src/spec_kitty_events/` to `spec-kitty/src/specify_cli/spec_kitty_events/`
- Converted all imports to relative imports (`.models`, `.storage`, etc.)
- Removed Git dependency from `pyproject.toml`
- Added `python-ulid>=1.1.0` dependency (required by events library)
- Updated `adapter.py` to import from vendored location: `from specify_cli.spec_kitty_events import ...`

### Consequences

#### Positive

* **Single package distribution**: Users install one package (`spec-kitty-cli`), get all functionality
* **No PyPI publishing overhead**: Don't need to maintain, version, and publish two packages
* **No dependency resolution issues**: Everything bundled together, no version conflicts
* **Faster releases**: Changes to events code don't require coordinated releases
* **Simplified CI/CD**: One release workflow, one set of credentials
* **Better for private development**: Can iterate on events without public API commitments

#### Negative

* **Larger package size**: Adds ~30KB to distribution (negligible)
* **Tighter coupling**: Events library can't be used independently by other projects
* **Harder to extract later**: If we need to separate it, requires migration
* **Duplicates pydantic dependency**: Both spec-kitty and events use pydantic (but same version range)

#### Neutral

* **Code organization**: Events code lives in `specify_cli/spec_kitty_events/` subdirectory
* **Import paths change**: From `spec_kitty_events` to `specify_cli.spec_kitty_events`
* **Version coupling**: Events version (0.1.0-alpha) now tied to spec-kitty version

### Confirmation

Success metrics:
- ✅ 0.13.20 published to PyPI without errors
- ✅ All 1,886 tests passing in CI
- ✅ `pip install spec-kitty-cli` works without additional setup
- ✅ Events functionality works via adapter layer
- ✅ No import errors from vendored module

Confidence level: **High** - This is standard practice for Python packages that include tightly-coupled utilities.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Publish spec-kitty-events as separate PyPI package

**Pros:**

* Independent versioning - can release events updates without spec-kitty release
* Reusable by other projects - events library available to ecosystem
* Cleaner separation of concerns - clear API boundary between packages
* Smaller individual packages - users who don't need events can skip it

**Cons:**

* **Doubled maintenance burden** - must maintain two PyPI projects, two release workflows, two sets of credentials
* **Coordinated releases required** - breaking changes in events require synchronized releases
* **User friction** - two `pip install` commands or complex dependency specification
* **Version compatibility complexity** - must document which spec-kitty versions work with which events versions
* **CI/CD complexity** - need SSH deploy keys or publish events first for every CI run

### Vendor spec-kitty-events into spec-kitty (CHOSEN)

**Pros:**

* **Single package distribution** - `pip install spec-kitty-cli` gets everything
* **Simplified maintenance** - one release workflow, one version number
* **No dependency resolution** - everything bundled, no version conflicts
* **Faster iteration** - change events code without public API stability concerns
* **Immediate PyPI compliance** - eliminates Git dependency issue

**Cons:**

* Larger package size - adds ~30KB (negligible for modern systems)
* Not independently reusable - other projects can't use events library
* Tighter coupling - events changes require spec-kitty release
* Harder to extract later - would require migration if we need separation

### Make spec-kitty-events an optional dependency

**Pros:**

* Users can choose whether to install events functionality
* Keeps package size minimal for users who don't need events
* Optional extras pattern (`pip install spec-kitty-cli[events]`) is standard

**Cons:**

* **Doesn't solve PyPI issue** - optional dependencies still can't be Git URLs
* Feature detection complexity - need runtime checks for events availability
* User confusion - "which features need events?" not obvious
* Testing complexity - must test both with and without events installed
* Documentation burden - must explain optional installation clearly

## Addendum: SimpleJsonStore — File-Backed EventStore Implementation (2026-02-15)

**Context:** Feature 043 (Telemetry Foundation) requires persisting `ExecutionEvent` records to disk. The vendored `spec_kitty_events` library provides an `EventStore` ABC (`save_event`, `load_events`, `load_all_events`) but only ships with `InMemoryEventStore` — no durable storage adapter was ever implemented. The `events/store.py` adapter layer contains a stub marked "will be implemented in WP02" that was never completed.

**Decision:** Implement `SimpleJsonStore` in `src/specify_cli/telemetry/store.py` as a JSONL-backed `EventStore` that completes the vendored library's storage story.

**Key design choices:**

| Choice | Decision | Rationale |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Storage format | JSONL (one JSON object per line, `sort_keys=True`) | Consistent with `status/store.py`, `mission_v1/events.py`, `sync/queue.py` |
| File location | Per-feature: `kitty-specs/<feature>/execution.events.jsonl` | Collocated with feature artifacts; `aggregate_id` maps to feature slug |
| Separation from status | Separate file from `status.events.jsonl` | Future aggregation is easier than categorizing mixed event types; status pipeline untouched |
| Write semantics | Append-only, idempotent by `event_id` | Single-process CLI — no file locking needed; dedup prevents double-writes |
| Read semantics | Stream-parsed (line-by-line) | Handles >100MB files without loading into memory |
| Malformed lines | Skip with warning, continue parsing | Consistent with existing `read_events()` behavior in `status/store.py` |
| Sort order | `(lamport_clock, node_id)` | Matches `InMemoryEventStore` and the merge semantics in ADR 2026-02-09-3 |

**Merge strategy for `execution.events.jsonl`:** Append-only logs with ULID-based `event_id` are naturally conflict-free during git merges. The concatenate-dedupe-sort-reduce algorithm from ADR 2026-02-09-3 applies if needed, but in practice execution events are immutable and written once per invocation — no concurrent modifications to the same event.

**Downstream consumers:** Features 044 (GovernanceEvents) and 046 (routing decisions) will reuse `SimpleJsonStore` for their own event types, establishing it as the standard file-backed persistence layer for the `spec_kitty_events.Event` model.

**Files:**
- `src/specify_cli/telemetry/store.py` — `SimpleJsonStore` implementing `spec_kitty_events.EventStore`
- `tests/specify_cli/telemetry/test_store.py` — unit tests
