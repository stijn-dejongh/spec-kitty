# Auto-Merge Multi-Parent Dependencies

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2026-01-23

**Deciders:** Spec Kitty Development Team

**Technical Story:** Git Repository Management Enhancement - Phase 2

---

## Context and Problem Statement

Work packages can depend on multiple other work packages (diamond dependency pattern). For example:

```
        WP01 (database)
       /    \
    WP02    WP03
  (users)  (auth)
       \    /
        WP04
     (admin UI)
```

WP04 depends on **both** WP02 and WP03. However, git worktrees can only branch from a **single** base commit. This created ambiguity:

**Previous approach:**
```bash
$ spec-kitty implement WP04
Error: WP04 has dependencies: ['WP02', 'WP03']
Specify --base: spec-kitty implement WP04 --base WP03
Then manually merge: git merge 010-feature-WP02
```

**Problems:**
- Arbitrary choice (why WP03 over WP02?)
- Manual merge steps required (error-prone)
- No validation that all dependencies were merged
- Non-deterministic (two runs could create different git histories)
- Burdens agents with manual merge operations

How do we handle multi-parent dependencies deterministically and automatically?

## Decision Drivers

* Git limitation: can only branch from one base commit
* Need deterministic behavior (same inputs → same outputs)
* Want to eliminate manual merge steps for agents
* Must validate all dependencies are included
* Should create reproducible git history
* Need clear conflict detection and reporting

## Considered Options

* **Option 1:** Require manual --base selection and manual merge (status quo)
* **Option 2:** Auto-merge all dependencies into temporary merge commit
* **Option 3:** Topological-first parent selection (pick earliest dependency)
* **Option 4:** Dependency weight-based selection (pick largest dependency)

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** "Option 2: Auto-merge all dependencies into temporary merge commit", because:
- Fully deterministic (same deps → same git tree)
- No manual merge steps required
- Validates all dependencies merged automatically
- Clear error on merge conflicts
- Reproducible builds

### Consequences

#### Positive

* Fully deterministic multi-parent handling
* No manual merge steps for agents
* All dependencies validated before workspace creation
* Clear conflict detection and reporting
* Reproducible git history
* Eliminates arbitrary base selection

#### Negative

* Creates additional merge commits (increases git graph complexity)
* Merge conflicts must be resolved before workspace creation
* Temporary branches persist after workspace creation
* Sequential merges (not octopus merge, slightly more commits)

#### Neutral

* Temporary merge base branch: `###-feature-WP##-merge-base`
* Dependencies sorted for deterministic merge order
* Merge strategy: sequential binary merges (not octopus)

### Confirmation

We'll validate this decision by:
- Multi-parent WPs create successfully without manual intervention
- Same dependencies produce same git tree hash
- Conflict detection catches incompatible dependencies early
- No reports of missing dependency code in merged workspaces
- Users find multi-parent workflow intuitive

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: Manual --base Selection + Manual Merge

**Pros:**
* Simple implementation (no auto-merge logic)
* User has full control over merge order
* Minimal git operations

**Cons:**
* Arbitrary base selection (non-deterministic)
* Manual merge steps burden agents
* No validation of complete dependency merge
* Error-prone (agents may forget to merge all deps)
* Inconsistent git histories across runs

### Option 2: Auto-Merge All Dependencies

**Pros:**
* Fully deterministic (sorted deps → same tree)
* No manual steps required
* All dependencies validated automatically
* Clear conflict detection
* Reproducible builds
* Agents don't need merge knowledge

**Cons:**
* Additional merge commits created
* Conflicts block workspace creation
* Temporary branches persist
* More complex implementation

### Option 3: Topological-First Parent Selection

**Pros:**
* Deterministic ordering (earliest dependency)
* Single base branch (simpler than merge)
* Fewer merge commits

**Cons:**
* Still requires manual merge of remaining deps
* Not all dependencies included automatically
* Partial solution (doesn't eliminate manual steps)

### Option 4: Dependency Weight-Based Selection

**Pros:**
* Intelligent base selection (largest impact)
* Potentially fewer merge conflicts

**Cons:**
* Still requires manual merge
* Non-deterministic if weights equal
* Complex heuristic (file count? lines changed?)
* Doesn't solve fundamental problem

## More Information

### Implementation Summary

**Algorithm:**
1. Sort dependencies for deterministic ordering
2. Create temp branch from first dependency
3. Merge remaining dependencies sequentially
4. Return merge commit SHA as base branch

**Temporary branch naming:** `###-feature-WP##-merge-base`

**Conflict handling:**
- Detects conflicts automatically
- Lists conflicting files in error message
- Aborts merge cleanly
- Cleans up temporary branch

**Test coverage:** 8 unit tests (merge logic, conflicts, diamond pattern) + 3 integration tests (end-to-end workflows)
