# Decorator-Based Context Validation

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2026-01-23

**Deciders:** Spec Kitty Development Team

**Technical Story:** Git Repository Management Enhancement - Phase 3

---

## Context and Problem Statement

Certain spec-kitty commands must run in specific locations to work correctly:
- `implement` must run from **main repository** (creates worktrees)
- `merge` must run from **main repository** (merges multiple worktree branches)
- Hypothetical workspace commands must run from **inside worktrees**

Running commands in the wrong location causes critical failures:

**Nested Worktree Problem** (Critical):
```bash
$ cd .worktrees/010-feature-WP02/  # Inside worktree
$ spec-kitty implement WP03         # Tries to create worktree from worktree
# Result: Nested worktrees, corrupted git state, repo unusable
```

**Previous solution:** Manual guard code in each command (20+ lines):
```python
def implement(wp_id: str):
    cwd = Path.cwd().resolve()
    if ".worktrees" in cwd.parts:
        console.print("Error: Cannot create worktrees from inside a worktree!")
        # ... 15 more lines of error handling ...
        raise typer.Exit(1)
    # ... actual implementation
```

**Problems with manual guards:**
- Verbose boilerplate in every command
- Easy to forget when adding new commands
- Inconsistent error messages
- Could be accidentally removed during refactoring
- No systematic framework for location validation

How do we enforce location requirements consistently and reliably?

## Decision Drivers

* **Critical: Must prevent nested worktrees** (causes git corruption)
* Need consistent location validation across all commands
* Want declarative approach (clear from function signature)
* Should reduce boilerplate code
* Must provide clear, actionable error messages
* Can't rely on agent discipline (need enforcement)
* Want reusable framework for all location-aware commands

## Considered Options

* **Option 1:** Manual guards in each command (status quo)
* **Option 2:** Decorator-based validation (`@require_main_repo`)
* **Option 3:** Pre-command hooks (global validation)
* **Option 4:** Wrapper scripts that validate before execution

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** "Option 2: Decorator-based validation", because:
- Declarative (clear from function definition)
- Reusable (single decorator for all commands)
- Can't be accidentally removed (part of function signature)
- Provides consistent error messages
- Minimal boilerplate (1 line vs 20+ lines)
- Pythonic approach (familiar to developers)
- Easy to test in isolation

### Consequences

#### Positive

* Prevents nested worktrees automatically (critical bug prevention)
* Consistent error messages across all commands
* Declarative validation (self-documenting code)
* Reduces code duplication (20+ lines → 1 line per command)
* Easy to add validation to new commands
* Clear from function signature what location is required
* Testable in isolation (23 dedicated tests)

#### Negative

* Adds decorator import to command files
* Runtime overhead (context detection on each call, ~1ms)
* Could be bypassed by calling function directly (not via CLI)

#### Neutral

* Three decorators: `@require_main_repo`, `@require_worktree`, `@require_either`
* Error messages include current location, required location, and fix command
* Context detection based on filesystem path analysis

### Confirmation

We'll validate this decision by:
- Zero instances of nested worktree creation
- No reports of commands running in wrong location
- Error messages successfully guiding users to correct location
- New commands correctly decorated
- Performance impact negligible (< 1ms)

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: Manual Guards in Each Command

**Pros:**
* Full control over error messages per command
* No framework overhead
* Simple to understand (explicit code)

**Cons:**
* Verbose boilerplate (20+ lines per command)
* Easy to forget for new commands
* Inconsistent error messages
* Can be accidentally removed
* No reusable framework
* Duplicated code across commands

### Option 2: Decorator-Based Validation

**Pros:**
* Declarative (clear from signature)
* Reusable (DRY principle)
* Can't be accidentally removed
* Consistent error messages
* Minimal boilerplate (1 line)
* Testable in isolation
* Pythonic approach

**Cons:**
* Adds import overhead
* Runtime detection cost (~1ms)
* Could be bypassed if function called directly

### Option 3: Pre-Command Hooks (Global Validation)

**Pros:**
* Centralized validation logic
* No per-command changes needed
* Could validate multiple aspects

**Cons:**
* Magic behavior (not clear from function)
* Hard to customize per command
* Difficult to test
* Framework complexity
* Unclear which commands are protected

### Option 4: Wrapper Scripts

**Pros:**
* Language-agnostic
* Could add shell-level checks

**Cons:**
* Extra layer of indirection
* Harder to maintain
* Not integrated with Python code
* Difficult to test
* Breaks direct Python imports

## More Information

### Implementation Summary

**Decorators provided:**
- `@require_main_repo` - Command must run from main repository
- `@require_worktree` - Command must run from inside a worktree
- `@require_either` - Command can run in either location (documentation only)

**Context detection:**
- Checks if ".worktrees" is in current path
- Extracts worktree name and repo root automatically
- Works from any subdirectory

**Environment variables:**
- `SPEC_KITTY_CONTEXT` - "main" or "worktree"
- `SPEC_KITTY_WORKTREE_NAME` - Worktree name (if in worktree)
- `SPEC_KITTY_REPO_ROOT` - Repository root path

**Test coverage:** 23 tests including critical nested worktree prevention tests

- Enables [2026-01-23-4-auto-merge-multi-parent-dependencies](2026-01-23-4-auto-merge-multi-parent-dependencies.md) by ensuring merge runs in main repo

- `src/specify_cli/cli/commands/merge.py:383` - `@require_main_repo` applied to merge
- `tests/unit/test_context_validation.py` - Test suite with critical nesting prevention tests

### Critical Bug Prevention

This decision **prevents nested worktrees**, which corrupts git state:
- Nested worktrees make repo unusable
- Requires manual recovery
- Could lose work if not detected

The decorator framework makes prevention **automatic and unforgeable** (can't be accidentally removed during refactoring).
