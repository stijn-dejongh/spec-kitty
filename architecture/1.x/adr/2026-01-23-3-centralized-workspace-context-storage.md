# Centralized Workspace Context Storage

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2026-01-23

**Deciders:** Spec Kitty Development Team

**Technical Story:** Git Repository Management Enhancement - Phase 1

## Context and Problem Statement

LLM agents working in worktrees need runtime visibility into workspace state (base branch, dependencies, creation time, etc.). While base branch is tracked in frontmatter ([ADR-2026-01-23-2](2026-01-23-2-explicit-base-branch-tracking.md)), frontmatter files are **excluded from worktrees** via sparse-checkout.

This creates a visibility problem:
- Agents in worktrees cannot read their own WP frontmatter
- Must query main repo to get workspace metadata
- No consolidated runtime context available in worktree
- Context information scattered across multiple sources

Where should we store runtime context information that is:
- Accessible from both main repo and worktrees
- Not subject to sparse-checkout exclusion
- Survives worktree deletion (for audit trail)
- Doesn't create merge conflicts

## Decision Drivers

* Agents in worktrees need runtime access to workspace metadata
* Context should be readable without querying main repo files
* Need audit trail that persists after worktree deletion
* Must not create merge conflicts or git state issues
* Should align with existing architecture patterns
* Want single query to get all workspace context

## Considered Options

* **Option 1:** Per-worktree `.spec-kitty-context` file
* **Option 2:** Centralized storage in `.kittify/workspaces/`
* **Option 3:** Environment variables only
* **Option 4:** Store in git config

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** "Option 2: Centralized storage in `.kittify/workspaces/`", because:
- Aligns with existing `.kittify/` pattern (config, metadata, merge-state all in `.kittify/`)
- Survives worktree deletion (audit trail)
- No sparse-checkout complexity (.kittify/ not excluded)
- Queryable from anywhere (main repo and worktrees)
- Simple cleanup on merge
- No risk of merge conflicts (files in main repo, not worktrees)

### Consequences

#### Positive

* Context accessible from both main repo and worktrees via relative path
* Persists after worktree deletion (post-mortem debugging)
* No .gitignore or sparse-checkout complexity
* Consistent with existing architecture (all state in `.kittify/`)
* Simple cleanup (delete JSON file)
* Queryable via CLI (`spec-kitty context info`)

#### Negative

* Context files stored separately from worktrees
* Agents must use relative path (`../../.kittify/workspaces/`)
* Could become orphaned if worktree deleted without cleanup

#### Neutral

* JSON format for context files
* One file per workspace: `###-feature-WP##.json`
* Cleanup command: `spec-kitty context cleanup`

### Confirmation

We'll validate this decision by:
- Agents successfully reading context from worktrees
- No reports of context visibility issues
- Orphaned context detection working correctly
- Performance acceptable (< 50ms to read context)

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: Per-Worktree `.spec-kitty-context` File

**Pros:**
* High visibility (in worktree root)
* No relative path needed
* Colocated with workspace files

**Cons:**
* Lost when worktree deleted (no audit trail)
* Requires gitignoring (untracked, ephemeral)
* Duplicates info from frontmatter
* Adds .gitignore complexity
* Could be accidentally committed
* Not accessible from main repo

### Option 2: Centralized Storage in `.kittify/workspaces/`

**Pros:**
* Survives worktree deletion (audit trail)
* No .gitignore complexity
* Consistent with `.kittify/` pattern
* Queryable from anywhere
* Simple cleanup
* No merge conflicts

**Cons:**
* Requires relative path from worktree
* Context stored separately from workspace
* Could become orphaned

### Option 3: Environment Variables Only

**Pros:**
* No files to manage
* Available to all processes
* Traditional Unix approach

**Cons:**
* Ephemeral (lost when shell exits)
* Not queryable after command finishes
* No audit trail
* Must be set manually
* Not accessible to new shells/processes

### Option 4: Store in Git Config

**Pros:**
* Git-native approach
* Persistent across shell sessions

**Cons:**
* Pollutes git config namespace
* Difficult to query programmatically
* Not human-readable
* Cleanup complex
* Non-standard use of git config

## More Information

### Implementation Summary

**Context file location:** `.kittify/workspaces/###-feature-WP##.json`

**Context includes:**
- WP ID, feature slug, worktree path, branch name
- Base branch and commit SHA
- Dependencies list
- Creation timestamp and VCS backend

**CLI commands:**
- `spec-kitty context info` - Show context for workspace
- `spec-kitty context list` - List all workspaces
- `spec-kitty context cleanup` - Remove orphaned contexts

**Test coverage:** 9 tests for persistence, orphaned detection, and visibility
