# Stakeholder Persona: External Architect Evaluator

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Category** | `EXTERNAL Stakeholder` |
| **Actor Type** | `human` |
| **Primary Goal** | Assess whether Spec Kitty architecture and decision model are robust enough for long-term organizational adoption. |
| **Persona ID** | `aud-ext-architect-evaluator` |
| **Created / Updated** | `2026-03-01` |
| **Domain / Context** | Spec Kitty architecture 2.x |
| **Status** | canonical |

## Overview

- **Role Focus**: System boundaries, decision traceability, and architecture lifecycle sustainability.
- **Primary Function**: Evaluates whether Spec Kitty supports defensible architecture governance and evolution in real organizations.
- **Environment / Context**: Teams with multi-year codebase stewardship and high sensitivity to architecture drift.

---

## Core Motivations

- **Professional Drivers**: Preserve coherent architecture direction and avoid undocumented, ad-hoc decision drift.
- **Emotional or Cognitive Drivers**: Prefers explicit rationale and model consistency over implicit convention.
- **Systemic Positioning**: Gatekeeper for architecture standards and governance fitness.

## Desiderata

| Category | Expectation / Need | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Information | Strong architecture narrative | Needs consistent domain, context, container, and component descriptions with clear boundaries. |
| Interaction | Traceable decision flow | Expects architectural behavior to be linked to ADR rationale and supersession history. |
| Support | Comparative evaluation material | Wants enough detail to compare Spec Kitty against existing architecture governance approaches. |
| Governance | Explicit authority boundaries | Requires clear separation between host authority and external integration adapters. |
| Decision Authority | Adoption sign-off influence | Can endorse or block architecture-level adoption decisions. |

---

## Frustrations and Constraints

- **Pain Points**: Documentation that is aspirational but not anchored to tested behavior.
- **Trade-Off Awareness**: Accepts initial complexity if it prevents long-term governance entropy.
- **Environmental Constraints**: Legacy architecture commitments, audit requirements, and migration risk exposure.

---

## Behavioral Cues

| Situation | Typical Behavior | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Stable / Routine | Reviews structural coherence periodically | Maintains long-term architecture health through regular review. |
| Change / Uncertainty | Requests explicit alternatives and consequences | Protects against narrow, under-explained architectural choices. |
| Under Pressure | Enforces minimum architecture invariants | Prioritizes boundary integrity over short-term convenience. |

---

## Collaboration Preferences

- **Decision Style**: Trade-off analysis with explicit consequences.
- **Communication Style**: Structured, rationale-heavy, and citation-backed.
- **Feedback Expectations**: Clear mismatch analysis between architecture docs and runtime/test behavior.

---

## Design Impact

- **Affected By**: C4 layering quality, lifecycle FSM clarity, and runtime boundary modeling.
- **Needs From Design**: Architecture corpus that remains trustworthy during evolution.
- **Risk If Ignored**: Rejection due to low confidence in governance durability.
- **Acceptance Signal**: Architecture docs remain coherent under change and align with test-inferred behavior.

## Measures of Success

| Dimension | Indicator | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Performance | Time to evaluate a major architecture proposal | Quantitative |
| Quality | Ratio of decisions with explicit alternatives and traceability | Quantitative |
| Growth | Confidence in maintaining architecture coherence over releases | Qualitative |

---

## Narrative Summary

The External Architect Evaluator focuses on whether Spec Kitty can sustain
architectural integrity over time, not just bootstrap a project quickly. They
need clear boundaries, traceable decisions, and consistent behavior modeling
before recommending adoption.
