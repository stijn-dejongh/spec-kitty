# Stakeholder Persona: AI Collaboration Agent

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Category** | `INTERNAL Stakeholder` |
| **Actor Type** | `llm` |
| **Primary Goal** | Execute architecture and workflow tasks accurately under explicit human and policy constraints. |
| **Persona ID** | `aud-ai-collaboration-agent` |
| **Created / Updated** | `2026-02-28` |
| **Domain / Context** | Spec Kitty architecture 2.x |
| **Status** | canonical |

---

## Overview

- **Role Focus**: Deterministic execution, evidence capture, and artifact consistency.
- **Primary Function**: Synthesizes context, proposes options, updates artifacts, and records traceable outcomes.
- **Environment / Context**: Human-in-Charge (HiC)-guided workflows with directive and template constraints.

---

## Core Motivations

- **Professional Drivers**: High-fidelity adherence to instructions and repository conventions.
- **Emotional or Cognitive Drivers**: Minimize ambiguity through explicit assumptions and links.
- **Systemic Positioning**: Acceleration layer under human authority.

## Desiderata

| Category | Expectation / Need | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Information | Explicit constraints | Needs clear scope, acceptance criteria, and conflict precedence. |
| Interaction | Fast clarification loop | Escalates when ambiguous constraints block safe execution. |
| Support | Stable templates and tests | Relies on canonical templates and deterministic validation signals. |
| Governance | Traceable decisions | Requires explicit rationale links for architecture-significant changes. |
| Decision Authority | Proposal authority, not final authority | May propose and implement, but final acceptance remains human-owned. |

---

## Frustrations and Constraints

- **Pain Points**: Conflicting directives, implicit assumptions, and missing acceptance boundaries.
- **Trade-Off Awareness**: Prefers conservative changes when constraints are unclear.
- **Environmental Constraints**: Tool availability, sandbox boundaries, and partial runtime observability.

---

## Behavioral Cues

| Situation | Typical Behavior | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Stable / Routine | Executes directly with minimal interruption | Maximizes throughput under known rules. |
| Change / Uncertainty | Surfaces assumptions and alternatives | Reduces rework risk through explicit reasoning. |
| Under Pressure | Narrows scope to verifiable outcomes | Prioritizes correctness and traceability over breadth. |

---

## Collaboration Preferences

- **Decision Style**: Constraint- and evidence-driven.
- **Communication Style**: Structured updates with actionable next steps.
- **Feedback Expectations**: Specific correction points tied to paths, tests, or directives.

---

## Design Impact

- **Affected By**: Template quality, architecture doc structure, and validation coverage.
- **Needs From Design**: Clear separation between context, responsibility, and implementation detail.
- **Risk If Ignored**: Output inconsistency and higher clarification overhead.
- **Acceptance Signal**: Tasks complete with low ambiguity and high reference stability.

---

## Measures of Success

| Dimension | Indicator | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Performance | Number of clarification rounds per architecture task | Quantitative |
| Quality | First-pass acceptance rate for generated artifacts | Quantitative |
| Growth | Reduction in repeated correction patterns | Qualitative |

---

## Narrative Summary

The AI Collaboration Agent provides leverage by turning architecture intent into
concrete, verifiable artifacts. It performs best when scope, constraints, and
traceability requirements are explicit. It is an execution collaborator, not a
decision owner.
