# Stakeholder Persona: System Architect

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Category** | `INTERNAL Stakeholder` |
| **Actor Type** | `human` |
| **Primary Goal** | Establish architecture boundaries that stay coherent as the system evolves. |
| **Persona ID** | `aud-system-architect` |
| **Created / Updated** | `2026-02-28` |
| **Domain / Context** | Spec Kitty architecture 2.x |
| **Status** | canonical |

---

## Overview

- **Role Focus**: Domain boundaries, decision quality, and long-term maintainability.
- **Primary Function**: Evaluates alternatives, confirms constraints, and formalizes decisions in ADRs.
- **Environment / Context**: Mid-to-high complexity codebases with multiple contributors and automation layers.

---

## Core Motivations

- **Professional Drivers**: Minimize architectural drift and undocumented decision debt.
- **Emotional or Cognitive Drivers**: Seeks consistency between intent, documentation, and runtime behavior.
- **Systemic Positioning**: Cross-cutting design authority and reviewer of structural changes.

## Desiderata

| Category | Expectation / Need | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Information | Evidence-backed options | Needs alternatives with measurable trade-offs. |
| Interaction | Structured design dialogue | Prefers phased discovery over ad hoc brainstorming. |
| Support | Traceability links | Requires clear mapping from decision to artifact and behavior. |
| Governance | ADR discipline | Expects explicit rationale and supersession patterns. |
| Decision Authority | Final on architecture direction | Approves container boundaries, integration patterns, and architectural constraints. |

---

## Frustrations and Constraints

- **Pain Points**: Architecture docs that duplicate code details or omit behavior rationale.
- **Trade-Off Awareness**: Accepts incremental complexity if it reduces long-term ambiguity.
- **Environmental Constraints**: Limited time, changing product priorities, partial historical context.

---

## Behavioral Cues

| Situation | Typical Behavior | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Stable / Routine | Defers low-impact decisions | Keeps focus on architecture-significant choices. |
| Change / Uncertainty | Demands alternatives and consequences | Prevents single-option anchoring. |
| Under Pressure | Applies locality-of-change discipline | Prefers reversible, proportionate changes. |

---

## Collaboration Preferences

- **Decision Style**: Analytical and trade-off driven.
- **Communication Style**: Written rationale with clear links to governing artifacts.
- **Feedback Expectations**: Concrete contradictions and correction proposals.

---

## Design Impact

- **Affected By**: C4 artifacts, ADR structure, and domain responsibility mapping.
- **Needs From Design**: Clear separation between context, containers, and component behavior.
- **Risk If Ignored**: Architecture drift and low-confidence planning.
- **Acceptance Signal**: New decisions can be traced to existing constraints without ambiguity.

---

## Measures of Success

| Dimension | Indicator | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Performance | Time to evaluate a new architecture proposal | Quantitative |
| Quality | Percentage of architecture decisions with explicit alternatives | Quantitative |
| Growth | Team ability to explain boundary rationale consistently | Qualitative |

---

## Narrative Summary

The System Architect is responsible for keeping Spec Kitty structurally coherent.
They care less about local implementation detail and more about whether boundaries,
contracts, and decisions form a consistent system narrative that contributors can
follow and evolve safely.
