# Stakeholder Persona: Project Codebase

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Category** | `INTERNAL Stakeholder` |
| **Actor Type** | `system` |
| **Primary Goal** | Preserve structural coherence while enabling safe, incremental change. |
| **Persona ID** | `aud-project-codebase` |
| **Created / Updated** | `2026-02-28` |
| **Domain / Context** | Spec Kitty architecture 2.x |
| **Status** | canonical |

---

## Overview

- **Role Focus**: Living implementation evidence and constraint surface.
- **Primary Function**: Provides actual naming, dependency, and behavior signals used to validate architecture choices.
- **Environment / Context**: Evolving repository with mixed historical decisions.

---

## Core Motivations

- **Professional Drivers**: N/A (system actor).
- **Emotional or Cognitive Drivers**: N/A (system actor).
- **Systemic Positioning**: Source of truth for implementation reality.

## Desiderata

| Category | Expectation / Need | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Information | Stable naming and boundaries | Benefits from clear vocabulary and modular contracts. |
| Interaction | Minimal disruptive refactors | Prefers proportional changes that preserve behavior confidence. |
| Support | Consistent architecture guidance | Needs docs that map to behavior and constraints, not class inventories. |
| Governance | Decision traceability | Should be explainable by linked architecture decisions. |
| Decision Authority | Constraint authority | Existing dependencies and behavior constrain feasible architecture choices. |

---

## Frustrations and Constraints

- **Pain Points**: Architectural proposals that ignore current coupling and migration cost.
- **Trade-Off Awareness**: Supports incremental modernization over all-at-once redesign.
- **Environmental Constraints**: Legacy structures, partial test coverage, and operational commitments.

---

## Behavioral Cues

| Situation | Typical Behavior | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Stable / Routine | Reinforces existing patterns | Existing structures bias future implementations. |
| Change / Uncertainty | Surfaces coupling hotspots | Reveals hidden constraints through breakage risk. |
| Under Pressure | Resists broad structural change | Favor targeted, reversible modifications. |

---

## Collaboration Preferences

- **Decision Style**: Evidence-constrained.
- **Communication Style**: Manifested through static structure, tests, and runtime behavior.
- **Feedback Expectations**: Architectural proposals should cite concrete implementation evidence.

---

## Design Impact

- **Affected By**: Domain boundary choices, container ownership, and integration patterns.
- **Needs From Design**: Migration-aware decisions with explicit implementation consequences.
- **Risk If Ignored**: Expensive refactors and architecture drift.
- **Acceptance Signal**: New architecture decisions can be implemented incrementally with low disruption.

---

## Measures of Success

| Dimension | Indicator | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Performance | Time to implement architecture-aligned changes | Quantitative |
| Quality | Coupling regressions after boundary changes | Quantitative |
| Growth | Consistency between naming in docs and code artifacts | Qualitative |

---

## Narrative Summary

The Project Codebase acts as the reality check for architecture ideas. It encodes
historical constraints and opportunities, and it rewards decisions that respect
incremental change. Architecture quality is reflected in how safely the codebase
can evolve.
