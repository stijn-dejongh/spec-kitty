# Stakeholder Persona: Spec Kitty CLI Runtime

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Category** | `INTERNAL Stakeholder` |
| **Actor Type** | `system` |
| **Primary Goal** | Enforce deterministic command behavior, artifact lifecycle rules, and governance boundaries. |
| **Persona ID** | `aud-spec-kitty-cli-runtime` |
| **Created / Updated** | `2026-02-28` |
| **Domain / Context** | Spec Kitty architecture 2.x |
| **Status** | canonical |

---

## Overview

- **Role Focus**: Command orchestration, policy execution, and artifact consistency.
- **Primary Function**: Validates prerequisites, routes mission flows, and manages state transitions.
- **Environment / Context**: Local-first repository workflows with optional external integrations.

---

## Core Motivations

- **Professional Drivers**: Deterministic outcomes across contributors and environments.
- **Emotional or Cognitive Drivers**: N/A (system actor).
- **Systemic Positioning**: Host boundary and runtime authority.

---

## Desiderata

| Category | Expectation / Need | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Information | Structured artifacts | Expects schema-compatible inputs and explicit command arguments. |
| Interaction | Predictable interfaces | Commands should have stable semantics and clear failure states. |
| Support | Testable contracts | Needs coverage for boundary rules and migration behavior. |
| Governance | Policy-backed execution | Runtime behavior must honor constitution and doctrine constraints. |
| Decision Authority | State transition authority | Owns canonical transition rules for command and task state changes. |

---

## Frustrations and Constraints

- **Pain Points**: Implicit defaults, missing metadata, and ambiguous command intent.
- **Trade-Off Awareness**: Accepts stricter validation for higher consistency.
- **Environmental Constraints**: Local filesystem realities and optional network-restricted execution.

---

## Behavioral Cues

| Situation | Typical Behavior | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Stable / Routine | Executes deterministic command paths | Normal operation with expected artifacts and transitions. |
| Change / Uncertainty | Emits validation errors and blocks unsafe transitions | Prevents silent corruption of project state. |
| Under Pressure | Prioritizes state integrity over convenience | Fails safely rather than applying ambiguous operations. |

---

## Collaboration Preferences

- **Decision Style**: Rule-based.
- **Communication Style**: Machine-readable and human-readable diagnostics.
- **Feedback Expectations**: Stable contracts with explicit migration notes.

---

## Design Impact

- **Affected By**: Runtime loop design, lifecycle model, and integration boundary decisions.
- **Needs From Design**: Unambiguous ownership boundaries and command semantics.
- **Risk If Ignored**: Drift between documented and actual runtime behavior.
- **Acceptance Signal**: Commands remain predictable across repositories and mission types.

---

## Measures of Success

| Dimension | Indicator | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Performance | Command success rate under documented prerequisites | Quantitative |
| Quality | Policy/contract regression incidence | Quantitative |
| Growth | Extensibility of mission/runtime model without breaking core flows | Qualitative |

---

## Narrative Summary

The Spec Kitty CLI Runtime is the enforcement surface that turns architecture and
governance intent into repeatable operational behavior. It is successful when
transitions are deterministic, boundaries are explicit, and failures are actionable.
