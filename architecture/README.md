# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains architectural design decisions, implementation specifications, and technical design documents for Spec Kitty.

## Purpose

The `architecture/` directory contains **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)** - immutable records of significant architectural decisions made for Spec Kitty.

## What is an ADR?

An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs:

- Document **why** decisions were made, not just what was decided
- Are **immutable** once accepted (new ADRs supersede old ones)
- Focus on **one decision** per document
- Include **alternatives considered** and why they were rejected
- Should be **concise** (1-2 pages maximum)
- Reference code directly for implementation details

**Note:** Implementation details are documented in code, tests, and docstrings. ADRs focus on decisions and link directly to code.

## Naming Conventions

### ADRs (Architectural Decision Records)

**Location:** `architecture/adrs/`

**Format:** `YYYY-MM-DD-N-descriptive-title-with-dashes.md`

**Rules:**

- **Date prefix:** Use date when decision was accepted (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Sequential number:** N is 1, 2, 3... for decisions on that day
- **Lowercase:** All letters in lowercase
- **Hyphens:** Use hyphens to separate words, not underscores
- **Present tense verbs:** Use imperative/present tense (e.g., "use", "adopt", "implement")
- **Descriptive:** Title should clearly indicate the decision topic

**Examples:**

- `2026-01-23-1-record-architecture-decisions.md`
- `2026-01-23-2-explicit-base-branch-tracking.md`
- `2026-02-15-1-use-sqlite-for-local-storage.md`
- `2026-02-15-2-adopt-react-for-ui-framework.md`

### Where to Put Implementation Details

ADRs should be **concise decision records** (1-2 pages). Put detailed implementation information in:

- **Code comments/docstrings** - For technical implementation details
- **Test files** - For usage examples and edge cases
- **`docs/` directory** - For user-facing documentation
- **`kitty-specs/` directory** - For feature specs (using spec-kitty's own workflow)
- **ADR "More Information" section** - Brief summary with code references

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR for every **architecturally significant decision**, including:

### Structure Decisions

- Choosing architectural patterns (microservices, monolith, layered architecture)
- Deciding on module/package organization
- Selecting component interaction patterns

### Technology Decisions

- Choosing frameworks or libraries (React vs Vue, SQLite vs PostgreSQL)
- Selecting build tools or development environments
- Adopting new programming languages or paradigms

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Security approaches (authentication methods, encryption strategies)
- Performance optimizations (caching strategies, database indexing)
- Scalability patterns (horizontal vs vertical scaling)

### Integration Decisions

- API design choices (REST vs GraphQL, versioning strategy)
- External service integrations
- Data exchange formats

### Process Decisions

- Development workflows (git branching strategy, release process)
- Testing strategies (unit vs integration test ratios, mocking approaches)
- Deployment approaches (CI/CD pipeline design)

### When NOT to Create an ADR

- Implementation details that don't affect architecture
- Temporary workarounds or tactical decisions
- Routine bug fixes or minor refactorings
- Decisions that can be easily reversed without significant impact

## How to Create a New ADR

### Step 1: Determine the Filename

Use today's date and find the next sequential number for that date.

```bash
# Check for existing ADRs today
ls architecture/adrs/ | grep "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
# If you see 2026-01-23-1, 2026-01-23-2, your next is 2026-01-23-3
# If no ADRs today, start with -1
```

### Step 2: Copy the Template

```bash
# Format: YYYY-MM-DD-N-your-decision-title.md
cp src/doctrine/templates/architecture/adr-template.md architecture/adrs/2026-01-23-3-your-decision-title.md
```

### Step 3: Fill Out the ADR

Use the template structure, ensuring you:

1. **Write a clear title** - Should be a noun phrase describing the decision
2. **Set status to "Proposed"** - Start all ADRs as "Proposed"
3. **Add context** - Explain the problem and why this decision matters
4. **List decision drivers** - What factors influenced this decision?
5. **Document all options** - Include rejected alternatives with pros/cons
6. **State the decision** - Be clear and assertive about the chosen option
7. **Document consequences** - Both positive and negative impacts
8. **Add confirmation criteria** - How will you validate this was the right choice?
9. **Keep it concise** - 1-2 pages maximum; link to code for details

### Step 4: Review Process

1. **Create a draft** - Initial version for team review
2. **Team review** - Allocate 10-15 minutes for team to read and comment
3. **Iterate** - Address feedback and questions
4. **Accept** - Once approved, change status to "Accepted" and add date
5. **Commit** - ADR becomes immutable once accepted

### Step 5: Update This README

Add an entry in the "Current Documentation" table above.

## Where to Put Implementation Details

ADRs should remain **concise** (1-2 pages). Put detailed implementation information in:

- **Code files** - Docstrings, comments, type hints
- **Test files** - Usage examples, edge cases
- **`docs/` directory** - User-facing documentation (tutorials, how-to guides)
- **`kitty-specs/` directory** - Feature specs if using spec-kitty workflow
- **Code references in ADRs** - Link directly to relevant code files

## ADR Best Practices

### Writing Good ADRs

1. **One Decision Per ADR** - If multiple decisions, create separate ADRs
2. **Keep It Concise** - Aim for 1-2 pages maximum
3. **Focus on "Why"** - Explain reasoning and tradeoffs, not implementation details
4. **Include Rejected Options** - Document why alternatives were not chosen
5. **Be Assertive** - State decisions clearly and confidently
6. **Immutable Once Accepted** - Don't edit accepted ADRs; supersede with new ones

### ADR Lifecycle

1. **Draft** - Create ADR using template, status = "Proposed"
2. **Review** - Team reviews (10-15 minutes allocated)
3. **Iterate** - Address feedback and questions
4. **Accept** - Change status to "Accepted", add date
5. **Commit** - ADR becomes immutable
6. **Supersede** (if needed) - Create new ADR, update old ADR status to "Superseded"

### When to Create an ADR

Create ADRs for **architecturally significant decisions** including:

**Structure:**

- Architectural patterns (microservices, monolith, layered)
- Module/package organization
- Component interaction patterns

**Technology:**

- Framework or library choices (React vs Vue, SQLite vs PostgreSQL)
- Build tools or development environments
- Programming language or paradigm adoption

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

- Security approaches (authentication, encryption)
- Performance optimizations (caching, indexing)
- Scalability patterns

**Integration:**

- API design (REST vs GraphQL, versioning)
- External service integrations
- Data exchange formats

**Process:**

- Development workflows (git strategy, release process)
- Testing strategies (unit vs integration ratios)
- Deployment approaches (CI/CD design)

### When NOT to Create an ADR

- Implementation details that don't affect architecture
- Temporary workarounds or tactical decisions
- Routine bug fixes or minor refactorings
- Decisions easily reversed without significant impact

## General Documentation Best Practices

1. **Keep It Current**: Update specs as implementations evolve (ADRs remain immutable)
2. **Link from Code**: Reference ADRs/specs in code comments for major components
3. **Version Control**: All architecture docs committed to git
4. **Peer Review**: Significant decisions reviewed before implementation
