# Migration and Shim Ownership Rules

*`architecture/2.x/06_migration_and_shim_rules.md`*
*Mission: migration-shim-ownership-rules-01KPDYDW (#615)*
*See also: [05_ownership_map.md](05_ownership_map.md) (slice inventory)*

---

## 1. Scope and Purpose

This rulebook governs how spec-kitty handles two related but distinct concerns during package extraction: **bundle and runtime migrations** (code that transforms project state when a new spec-kitty version is installed) and **compatibility shims** (thin Python re-export modules that preserve an old import path while the canonical location moves). It exists because mission #615 identified that ad-hoc handling of these concerns had produced undocumented shims, unclear removal timelines, and no CI gate to catch newly introduced shims that bypassed the registry.

Every extraction mission — #612, #613, #614, and any future slice extraction — must cite this document in its implementation plan and follow the rule families described here. The CI enforcement surfaces are `spec-kitty doctor shim-registry` (exit codes 0/1/2) and the architectural pytest suite (`tests/architectural/`).

Doctrine versioning for these artifacts (schema-version extension to doctrine artifacts themselves) is tracked separately under #461 Phase 7 and is **not** implemented by this mission.

---

## 2. Rule Family (a) — Project Schema and Version Gating

Spec-kitty's `.kittify/` artifacts and mission bundles carry a `schema-version` field. The current contract is:

- **`.kittify/` artifacts**: Schema version is defined per-artifact type in `src/specify_cli/missions/*/mission.yaml`. A migration module must check the schema version of the artifact it is upgrading and refuse to apply if the version is outside its supported range, raising a clear error that names the installed spec-kitty version and the artifact's schema version.
- **Mission bundles**: `kitty-specs/<mission>/meta.json` carries a `schema_version` field. Tools that consume mission bundles should reject bundles with an unknown major schema version and warn on unknown minor versions.

The runtime reads the project version from `pyproject.toml` via `tomllib` (`[project].version`). This value is used exclusively for semver comparison against `removal_target_release` entries in the shim registry. Pre-release suffixes (e.g., `3.3.0a1`) are handled by `packaging.version.Version`, which correctly treats `3.3.0a1 < 3.3.0`.

**Cross-reference**: #461 Phase 7 plans to extend schema-version gating to doctrine artifacts (directives, paradigms, procedures). That work is not in scope here; this rule family covers only `.kittify/` artifacts and mission bundles.

---

## 3. Rule Family (b) — Bundle and Runtime Migration Authoring Contract

A migration module lives under `src/specify_cli/upgrade/migrations/` and is named `m_<version_slug>_<slug>.py` (e.g., `m_0_9_1_complete_lane_migration.py`). Each module must export a class that inherits from `BaseMigration` and implements a single `apply(project_path: Path, dry_run: bool = False) -> None` method.

**Idempotency requirement**: `apply()` must be safe to call multiple times on the same project. Use existence checks (`if not target.exists()`) or content-hash comparisons rather than unconditional writes. A failed partial migration followed by a retry must produce the same final state as a successful first run.

**Dry-run contract**: When `dry_run=True`, `apply()` must not write any files, run any shell commands, or emit any git commits. It should report what it *would* do to stdout (using `rich` where appropriate). The dry-run path must be exercised by at least one test.

**Test expectations**: Each migration module must have a corresponding test in `tests/specify_cli/upgrade/migrations/` that:
1. Creates a synthetic project directory via `tmp_path`.
2. Calls `apply(project_path)` once (normal run).
3. Asserts the expected files/changes are present.
4. Calls `apply(project_path)` a second time (idempotency check).
5. Asserts the project state is unchanged after the second call.

**Naming conventions**: The migration class must be named `Migration` (singular). The module-level constant `MIGRATION_ID` must be a string matching the filename without the `.py` extension. The migration registry in `src/specify_cli/upgrade/registry.py` discovers migrations by scanning this constant.

**How a migration entry-point is registered and invoked**: Migrations are discovered automatically by `MigrationRegistry.discover()`, which imports all `m_*.py` modules under the migrations directory and collects their `Migration` classes. The `spec-kitty upgrade` command invokes `MigrationRegistry.run_pending(project_path)`, which filters to migrations with a version greater than the project's last-applied migration version (stored in `.kittify/migration-state.json`).

## 4. Rule Family (c) — Compatibility Shim Lifecycle

A compatibility shim is a Python module at the **old** import path that re-exports all public symbols from the **new canonical** package. Its sole purpose is to give downstream callers a deprecation window before the old path is removed.

### When to introduce a shim

A shim is required when all three conditions hold:
1. A package is being relocated (old path `specify_cli.X` → new path `X`).
2. The old path was part of a documented or discoverable public API.
3. At least one external caller (outside the `specify_cli` package itself) imports from the old path.

If condition 3 is not met — that is, if all callers are internal and can be migrated atomically — no shim is needed. The removal of the old path is then a pure refactor with no deprecation window required. The shim registry records this as the "no-shim baseline case" (see Section 7).

### Mandatory shim module shape

Every shim must include these six attributes, with no omissions:

```python
"""Compatibility shim — re-exports from <canonical_package>.

Deprecated: import from <canonical_package> instead. Scheduled for removal in <X.Y.Z>.
"""
from __future__ import annotations

import warnings

from <canonical_package> import *  # noqa: F401, F403
from <canonical_package> import __all__  # if canonical defines __all__

__deprecated__ = True
__canonical_import__ = "<canonical_package>"
__removal_release__ = "<X.Y.Z>"
__deprecation_message__ = (
    "specify_cli.<legacy_name> is deprecated; import from <canonical_package>. "
    "Scheduled for removal in <X.Y.Z>."
)

warnings.warn(__deprecation_message__, DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
```

The `warnings.warn(..., stacklevel=2)` call executes at import time so that any import of the shim module immediately surfaces the deprecation to the calling code's stack frame (not the shim's own frame).

### Deprecation window

A shim must remain in place for **at least one full minor release** after the canonical path is available. The `removal_target_release` in the registry must be at least one minor version ahead of the release in which the shim was introduced (e.g., introduced in `3.2.0` → removal no earlier than `3.3.0`).

Extension beyond one release is permitted when external consumers have been notified but need additional time. In that case, the registry entry must include `extension_rationale` with a non-empty explanation (e.g., "downstream consumer org X requires migration window per support contract until 2026-Q3"). The `grandfathered: true` flag is reserved for shims that existed before this rulebook and for which a normal removal timeline cannot be applied; all new shims introduced after this mission must set `grandfathered: false`.

---

## 5. Rule Family (d) — Removal Plans and Registry Contract

### Registry schema

The registry at `architecture/2.x/shim-registry.yaml` is the authoritative list of all known compatibility shims. Its schema is defined in `kitty-specs/migration-shim-ownership-rules-01KPDYDW/contracts/shim-registry-schema.yaml`. Each entry requires:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `legacy_path` | string | Dotted Python import path of the shim (e.g., `specify_cli.charter`) |
| `canonical_import` | string or list | The new canonical import path(s) |
| `introduced_in_release` | semver string | Version when the shim was first introduced |
| `removal_target_release` | semver string | Version when the shim will be removed; must be ≥ introduced_in_release |
| `tracker_issue` | string | GitHub issue reference (`#NNN` or URL) tracking the removal |
| `grandfathered` | boolean | `true` only for pre-rulebook shims; new entries must be `false` |
| `extension_rationale` | string (optional) | Required if removal window extends past one minor release |
| `notes` | string (optional) | Free-form notes for reviewers |

### How to add a new entry

1. Copy the shim template from Section 4 into the appropriate `src/specify_cli/<legacy_name>.py` or `src/specify_cli/<legacy_name>/__init__.py`.
2. Add an entry to `architecture/2.x/shim-registry.yaml` with all required fields.
3. Open a tracker issue for the removal and record its reference in `tracker_issue`.
4. Run `spec-kitty doctor shim-registry` and confirm it exits 0 with the new entry showing `pending` status.
5. Follow the quickstart at `kitty-specs/migration-shim-ownership-rules-01KPDYDW/quickstart.md` for a step-by-step checklist.

### Removal PR contract

When `removal_target_release` is reached, the removal PR must:

1. **Delete** the shim module file (`src/specify_cli/<legacy_name>.py` or `src/specify_cli/<legacy_name>/__init__.py`).
2. **Update** the registry entry — either remove it entirely or mark it with a `removed_in_release` note (convention TBD by the removing engineer; the entry may be deleted once CI passes).
3. **Add** a `CHANGELOG.md` entry under `### Removed` with the release version.
4. **Close** the tracker issue referenced in `tracker_issue`.
5. **Confirm** CI passes: `spec-kitty doctor shim-registry` must exit 0 after the removal.

## 6. CI Enforcement

### `spec-kitty doctor shim-registry`

This command reads `architecture/2.x/shim-registry.yaml`, loads `[project].version` from `pyproject.toml`, and classifies each registered shim:

| Exit code | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| 0 | All entries are `pending`, `grandfathered`, or `removed` — no action required |
| 1 | One or more entries are `overdue` (current project version ≥ `removal_target_release` and shim file still present) |
| 2 | Configuration error — `pyproject.toml` or `shim-registry.yaml` is missing or malformed |

Statuses:
- **pending**: `removal_target_release` > current version; shim file exists — normal lifecycle
- **overdue**: `removal_target_release` ≤ current version; shim file still exists — removal is due
- **grandfathered**: `grandfathered: true` — never classified as overdue regardless of version
- **removed**: shim file no longer exists on disk — entry is historical

### `tests/architectural/test_unregistered_shim_scanner.py`

This test walks `src/specify_cli/` using Python's `ast` module, detects any module containing `__deprecated__ = True`, and asserts that every detected path appears in the registry. The test fails if a shim module exists on disk but has no registry entry. This prevents engineers from introducing a shim without registering it.

The scanner detects both `__deprecated__ = True` (assignment) and `__deprecated__: bool = True` (annotated assignment) forms.

### `tests/architectural/test_shim_registry_schema.py`

This test loads the live `architecture/2.x/shim-registry.yaml` and runs it through `validate_registry()`. It also exercises the validator against known-bad fixtures (missing required fields, wrong types, bad semver, invalid tracker references, `removal_target_release < introduced_in_release`) to confirm that `RegistrySchemaError` is raised with a field-specific message for each violation.

## 7. Worked Example — Charter Mission

Mission `charter-ownership-consolidation-and-neutrality-hardening-01KPD880` (GitHub #611, #653) is the reference case for applying this rulebook.

**Rule family (a) — Schema and version gating**: The charter mission performed a bulk-edit import-path migration from `specify_cli.charter.*` to `charter.*`. Schema version fields in `.kittify/` artifacts were not altered by this mission; the mission used the existing schema version contract without modification.

**Rule family (b) — Migration authoring contract**: The charter mission produced occurrence maps and bulk-edit tooling to migrate callers from `specify_cli.charter.*` to `charter.*`. Internal callers (within `specify_cli`) were migrated atomically as part of the bulk edit. No migration module in `src/specify_cli/upgrade/migrations/` was required for this operation because it was a same-release refactor rather than a schema upgrade.

**Rule family (c) — Compatibility shim lifecycle (no-shim baseline case)**: The `src/specify_cli/charter/` directory was audited before this mission. At mission start (2026-04-19), `src/specify_cli/charter/__init__.py` did not exist — the directory contained only `__pycache__/`. This confirms that the canonical move from `specify_cli.charter.*` to `charter.*` had **no external importers** at extraction time; all callers were internal and were migrated atomically.

Consequently, **no shim was introduced** for the charter migration. This is a valid exception to rule family (c): the shim precondition (external callers) was not met. The registry records this by remaining empty at mission-615 start, with a comment noting the zero-shim baseline.

The charter mission therefore demonstrates rule family (c) by *not* introducing a shim, and documents this decision explicitly rather than silently omitting the step. Any future extraction mission that similarly has no external callers should follow this precedent and add a comment in its implementation notes stating: *"No compatibility shim introduced — all callers were internal and migrated atomically."*

**Rule family (d) — Removal plans and registry contract**: Because no shim was introduced, no registry entry was created for `specify_cli.charter`. The registry baseline remains `shims: []`. Future extraction missions that *do* introduce shims (e.g., if a public-facing package with documented external callers is relocated) will add entries following the schema in Section 5.
