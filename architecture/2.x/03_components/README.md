# 2.x Components

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | Draft |
| Date | 2026-03-01 |
| Scope | C4 Level 3 logical component view |
| Related ADRs | `2026-01-29-13`, `2026-02-09-1..4`, `2026-02-17-1..3`, `2026-02-23-1..3`, `2026-02-25-1..3` |

## Purpose

Define component-level boundaries for Spec Kitty 2.x while remaining
implementation-agnostic and behavior-focused.

## Scope Rules

1. Focus on conceptual components and contracts, not file/class listings.
2. Explain behavior and interaction patterns that matter architecturally.
3. Keep component definitions aligned with container boundaries and ADR decisions.

| Sync Transport Session | Manages authenticated realtime and delivery sessions |
| Tracker Connector Gateway | Adapts host state to external tracker APIs |

## Behavioral Sequences

### Sequence A: Canonical `next` Decisioning (No Direct Mutation)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as Human/Agent
    participant Router as Command Router
    participant Loop as Next Loop Coordinator
    participant Mission as Mission Discovery and Resolution
    participant Doctrine as Doctrine Catalog Loader

    User->>Router: invoke next-style command
    Router->>Loop: dispatch runtime action
    Loop->>Mission: resolve mission assets
    Mission->>Doctrine: load and validate doctrine context
    Doctrine-->>Loop: validated context
    Loop-->>User: next-action recommendation
```

### Sequence B: Lifecycle Mutation and Target-Line Routing

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as Human/Agent
    participant Router as Command Router
    participant StatusCmd as Status Mutation Command Set
    participant Route as Target-Line Router
    participant State as WP Lifecycle Engine
    participant Events as Event Semantics Reducer

    User->>Router: invoke lifecycle mutation
    Router->>StatusCmd: dispatch mutation command
    StatusCmd->>Route: resolve target-line routing
    Route->>State: validate guarded transition
    State->>Events: append event and materialize state
    Events-->>User: mutation result and authoritative state
```

### Sequence C: Sync Projection Reliability Path

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Events as Event Semantics Reducer
    participant Sync as Sync Runtime Coordinator
    participant Identity as Sync Identity Resolver
    participant Clock as Lamport Clock Coordinator
    participant Queue as Offline Queue Manager
    participant Transport as Sync Transport Session
    participant Tracker as Tracker Connector Gateway

    Events->>Sync: enqueue projection candidate
    Sync->>Identity: ensure event identity
    Sync->>Clock: assign ordering metadata
    Sync->>Queue: persist durable queue item
    Sync->>Transport: attempt authenticated delivery
    Transport->>Tracker: project tracker update
```

### Sequence D: Governance Update and Runtime Reuse

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Human as Human In Charge
    participant GovCmd as Governance Command Set
    participant Interview as Constitution Interview Flow
    participant Compile as Constitution Compiler
    participant Resolver as Action Context Resolver

    Human->>GovCmd: start governance update
    GovCmd->>Interview: collect governance answers
    Interview->>Compile: compile constitution bundle
    Compile->>Resolver: refresh action context projection
    Resolver-->>GovCmd: updated governance context
    GovCmd-->>Human: confirmation and next actions
```

## Canonical Work Package FSM

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> planned
    planned --> claimed: claim (actor)
    claimed --> in_progress: start (workspace_context)
    in_progress --> for_review: ready_for_review (subtasks + evidence)
    for_review --> done: approve (done evidence)

    for_review --> in_progress: changes_requested (review_ref)
    for_review --> planned: replan (review_ref)
    in_progress --> planned: reassign (reason)

    planned --> blocked: blocked
    claimed --> blocked: blocked
    in_progress --> blocked: blocked
    for_review --> blocked: blocked
    blocked --> in_progress: unblock

    planned --> canceled: cancel
    claimed --> canceled: cancel
    in_progress --> canceled: cancel
    for_review --> canceled: cancel
    blocked --> canceled: cancel
```

Guard summary:
1. Canonical lanes: `planned`, `claimed`, `in_progress`, `for_review`, `done`, `blocked`, `canceled`.
2. `done` and `canceled` are terminal unless an explicit force override is used.
3. Transition guard requirements are transition-specific and include actor, workspace context, review reference, done evidence, and explicit reason fields.

## Coupling and Trade-off Notes

1. `next` loop centralization improves consistency but requires strict mission compatibility discipline.
2. Runtime decisioning and lifecycle mutation are intentionally separated, reducing hidden side effects.
3. Governance and doctrine coupling is deliberate to preserve policy traceability.
4. Sync reliability internals are explicit because ordering/durability constraints affect system behavior.
5. Tracker connector isolation keeps third-party integration optional and bounded.

## Decision Traceability

<!-- DECISION: 2026-02-09-2 - Enforce explicit lifecycle transitions via dedicated engine -->
<!-- DECISION: 2026-02-25-1 - Keep verify/doctor command taxonomy separate from workflow commands -->
