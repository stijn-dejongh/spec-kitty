| Technical Story | Enhances ADR-4's auto-merge behavior with proactive guidance when all multi-parent dependencies are completed, preventing auto-merge conflicts by suggesting merge-first workflow. |

---

## Context and Problem Statement

ADR-4 established auto-merge for multi-parent dependencies (e.g., WP04 depends on WP01, WP02, WP03). However, real-world testing (~/tmp Feature 001) revealed a problematic scenario:

**What happened:**
```
1. WP01, WP02, WP03 all completed (in "done" lane)
2. Each modified .gitignore independently
3. Agent ran: spec-kitty implement WP04
4. Auto-merge attempted: WP01 + WP02 + WP03
5. FAILED: .gitignore add/add conflicts
6. Agent manually merged each WP to main
7. Then started WP04 from main
```

**The pattern:**
- When dependencies are **in progress** (doing/for_review), auto-merge makes sense (combine work-in-progress)
- When dependencies are **completed** (done lane), auto-merge is **risky** (likely conflicts on shared files)

**Question:** Should we detect when all multi-parent dependencies are complete and suggest merging them to main **before** implementing the dependent WP?

## Decision Drivers

* **Conflict prevention** - Completed WPs likely modified shared files (.gitignore, package.json, etc.)
* **User experience** - Agents got stuck with auto-merge failures (trial-and-error)
* **Workflow clarity** - Merge-first vs auto-merge have different use cases
* **Agent guidance** - LLMs need explicit recommendations, not trial-and-error
* **ADR-4 enhancement** - Build on auto-merge, don't replace it
* **Backward compatibility** - Existing workflows must still work

## Considered Options

* **Option 1:** Detect all-done and suggest merge-first (error + guidance)
* **Option 2:** Attempt auto-merge, fall back on conflict (reactive)
* **Option 3:** Always require manual merge for multi-parent (strict)
* **Option 4:** Status quo (auto-merge always, user handles conflicts)

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** "Option 1: Detect all-done and suggest merge-first", because:
- Proactive (detects problem before attempting)
- Educational (explains why merge-first is safer)
- Flexible (--force override for auto-merge if needed)
- Agent-friendly (clear guidance, not trial-and-error)
- Prevents common failure mode (all-done + auto-merge = conflicts)

### Consequences

#### Positive

* **Proactive guidance** - Detects problem before attempting auto-merge
* **Clear workflow** - Agent knows to run merge command first
* **Conflict control** - Merge conflicts resolved in structured manner
* **Prevents confusion** - No trial-and-error with auto-merge failures
* **Explicit choice** - Agent can choose merge-first or --force auto-merge
* **ADR-4 enhancement** - Auto-merge still available for work-in-progress scenarios

#### Negative

* **Extra step** - Must run merge command before implement
* **Two commands** - merge then implement (instead of one)
* **Code complexity** - Adds detection logic to implement command
* **User decision** - Agent must choose between merge-first and --force

#### Neutral

* **Detection trigger** - Multi-parent + all done → suggest merge
* **Override mechanism** - --force flag bypasses suggestion
* **Error message** - Blocks implement, suggests merge command
* **Still automatic** - If not all done, auto-merge proceeds normally

### Confirmation

We validated this decision by:
- ✅ 7 tests for dependency detection logic
- ✅ check_dependency_status() correctly identifies all-done scenarios
- ✅ get_merge_strategy_recommendation() provides clear guidance
- ✅ implement command blocks with actionable error message
- ✅ ~/tmp WP04 scenario would now get clear guidance upfront

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: Detect all-done and suggest merge-first (CHOSEN)

Pre-flight check before auto-merge. If all dependencies done, error with suggestion.

**Pros:**
* Proactive detection (before failure)
* Clear guidance (suggests exact command)
* Explains trade-offs (merge-first vs auto-merge)
* Prevents common failure mode
* Agent-friendly (no trial-and-error)

**Cons:**
* Extra step (two commands instead of one)
* Code complexity (detection logic)
* Requires --force to override

### Option 2: Attempt auto-merge, fall back on conflict (status quo)

Try auto-merge, if fails, guide user to manual merge.

**Pros:**
* Works for non-conflicting cases
* No pre-flight overhead
* Simpler code (no detection)

**Cons:**
* Reactive (fails first, then suggests)
* Trial-and-error experience
* Wastes time on predictable failures
* Confusing for agents (did it fail or not?)

### Option 3: Always require manual merge

Block multi-parent entirely, force user to merge first.

**Pros:**
* No surprises (never attempts auto-merge)
* Explicit control over all merges

**Cons:**
* Loses auto-merge benefits for work-in-progress
* Too restrictive (many WPs could auto-merge cleanly)
* Breaks existing workflows

### Option 4: Status quo (auto-merge always)

Always attempt auto-merge for multi-parent, let git handle it.

**Pros:**
* No changes needed
* Works for non-conflicting cases

**Cons:**
* Predictable failures (all-done + shared files = conflict)
* No guidance (agent stuck)
* Poor UX (trial-and-error)

## More Information

**Implementation:**
- `src/specify_cli/core/dependency_resolver.py` (new module)
  - `check_dependency_status()` - Detects if all deps done
  - `get_merge_strategy_recommendation()` - Suggests workflow
  - `predict_merge_conflicts()` - Future: dry-run prediction
- `src/specify_cli/cli/commands/implement.py` - Pre-flight check integration
- `src/specify_cli/missions/software-dev/command-templates/tasks.md` - Updated guidance

**Tests:**
- `tests/integration/test_auto_merge_dependencies.py` (7 tests)
- All scenarios validated: all-done, partial-done, single-parent, multi-parent

**Decision Logic:**
```
IF multi-parent AND all dependencies in "done" lane:
  → Suggest: spec-kitty merge --feature <slug>
  → Block: Cannot proceed without --force
  → Explain: Merge-first avoids conflicts

ELSE IF multi-parent AND any dependency doing/for_review:
  → Proceed: Auto-merge (combine work-in-progress)

ELSE IF single-parent:
  → Suggest: Use --base flag
```

**Related ADRs:**
- ADR-4: Auto-Merge Multi-Parent Dependencies (original design)
- ADR-13: Target Branch Routing (status commits advance target, causing staleness)

**Enhances:** ADR-4 (auto-merge still works, now with smart guidance)

**Version:** 0.13.8 improvement (agent guidance enhancement)
