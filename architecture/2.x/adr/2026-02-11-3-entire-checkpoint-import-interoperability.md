---

## Context and Problem Statement

Entire.io is a Tier 1 competitive threat building multi-agent orchestration with session capture infrastructure. Their production-ready system (990 commits) stores AI agent session checkpoints in Git using a dedicated branch (`entire/checkpoints/v1`) with JSONL transcript format.

**Entire.io's Value Proposition**: Session history, rewind capability, attribution tracking (agent vs human line-level)

**Spec Kitty's Value Proposition**: Spec-driven orchestration, cross-repo convergence, team SaaS, progressive privacy

There is potential for complementary value: Users may want BOTH session history (Entire) AND orchestration (Spec Kitty). However, we face an architectural decision:

1. **Adopt Git-native storage** (Entire's approach): Store events on Git branches instead of PostgreSQL
2. **Build interoperability** (import Entire checkpoints): Read their format, convert to our events
3. **Ignore Entire** (compete head-to-head): Build everything ourselves, no compatibility

Adopting Git-native storage contradicts ADR 2026-02-09-1 (Canonical WP Status Model), which established PostgreSQL JSONL as the event log foundation for team SaaS. Git-native storage cannot support:
- Real-time queries (dashboard aggregations, WP status lookups)
- Multi-tenant isolation (teams see only their projects)
- CRDT conflict resolution (requires database transactions)
- WebSocket sync (requires event log subscriptions)

However, ignoring Entire misses partnership/acquisition opportunities and forces users to choose one tool or the other.

**Strategic Question**: How can Spec Kitty leverage Entire's session infrastructure without compromising our SaaS architecture?

## Decision Drivers

* **Preserve SaaS architecture**: PostgreSQL event log (ADR 2026-02-09-1) is correct for team SaaS
* **Enable interoperability**: Users should be able to use BOTH tools (Entire for sessions, Spec Kitty for orchestration)
* **Partnership potential**: Compatible format enables future integration or acquisition discussions
* **Focus on strengths**: Spec Kitty excels at orchestration; Entire excels at session capture infrastructure
* **Avoid duplication**: Don't rebuild session capture when Entire solves it well
* **Strategic optionality**: Keep acquisition option open (estimated $10-30M if they gain traction)
* **User flexibility**: Don't force "either Entire or Spec Kitty" choice

## Considered Options

* **Option 1**: Build EntireCheckpointReader (import only) - chosen
* **Option 2**: Adopt Git-native storage (replace PostgreSQL)
* **Option 3**: Build own session capture (duplicate Entire)
* **Option 4**: Ignore Entire (no compatibility)

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** "Build EntireCheckpointReader for optional import", because:

1. **Preserves architecture**: Keeps PostgreSQL event log (ADR 2026-02-09-1) for team SaaS queries, dashboards
2. **Enables interoperability**: Users can run Entire (session capture) + Spec Kitty (orchestration) together
3. **Partnership optionality**: Compatible format enables acquisition discussions if Entire gains traction
4. **Focus on strengths**: Leverage Entire's session infrastructure instead of rebuilding
5. **Low risk**: Import is optional feature, doesn't affect core architecture
6. **Strategic**: Positions as "orchestration layer" complementary to Entire's "infrastructure layer"

**Implementation**: Create `EntireCheckpointReader` class in `spec_kitty_events/sources/entire_checkpoint.py` to read `entire/checkpoints/v1` branch and convert to Spec Kitty `Event` objects. Store imported sessions in PostgreSQL event log (NOT Git).

### Consequences

#### Positive

* **Interoperability proof**: Users can use both tools together (Entire for history, Spec Kitty for orchestration)
* **Partnership potential**: Compatible format opens acquisition/integration discussions with Entire team
* **Focus on strengths**: Avoid scope creep into session capture infrastructure (Entire solves this)
* **Unified history**: Imported sessions appear in Spec Kitty dashboard alongside WP events
* **Attribution data**: Extract agent vs human attribution from Entire checkpoints for transparency
* **Strategic optionality**: Acquisition path preserved ($10-30M estimated if they reach scale)

#### Negative

* **Maintenance burden**: Must keep reader compatible with Entire's checkpoint format (risk of breaking changes)
* **Dependency risk**: If Entire shuts down or pivots, import feature becomes obsolete
* **Format lock-in**: Tightly coupled to Entire's JSONL format (migration cost if they change)
* **Limited value if Entire fails**: If Entire doesn't gain traction, import feature has low ROI
* **Complexity**: Adds another event source to maintain (Git branch reading, JSONL parsing)

#### Neutral

* **Optional feature**: Doesn't affect users who don't use Entire (zero impact on core flows)
* **One-way import**: Spec Kitty imports from Entire, but doesn't export to Entire format (asymmetric)
* **Storage remains PostgreSQL**: Imported events stored in PostgreSQL (not Git), maintains SaaS architecture

### Confirmation

**Success Metrics**:
* **Compatibility**: Successfully import 100+ Entire checkpoints without errors
* **Adoption**: 5-10% of Spec Kitty users also use Entire (indicates interoperability value)
* **Partnership**: Initiate discussions with Entire team (if they gain traction: 5K+ GitHub stars, funding)
* **Format stability**: Entire's checkpoint format remains stable (no breaking changes in 6 months)

**Validation Timeline**:
* **Month 1**: Implement EntireCheckpointReader, test with sample Entire repository
* **Month 2**: Release CLI command (`spec-kitty import-sessions --source entire`)
* **Month 3-6**: Monitor adoption, format stability, partnership signals

**Confidence Level**: **MEDIUM** (6/10)
* **High confidence**: Interoperability is valuable (users can combine tools)
* **Medium confidence**: Entire will gain traction (Tier 1 threat, but early stage)
* **Low confidence**: Format will remain stable (no version control guarantees from Entire)
* **Mitigation**: Import is optional, can deprecate if Entire fails or format breaks

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Build EntireCheckpointReader (Import Only) - Chosen

**Description**: Read Entire checkpoints from Git branch, convert to Spec Kitty events, store in PostgreSQL.

**Pros:**

* Preserves SaaS architecture (PostgreSQL event log)
* Enables interoperability (users can use both tools)
* Partnership optionality (acquisition path preserved)
* Focus on strengths (leverage Entire's infrastructure)
* Low risk (optional feature, doesn't affect core)
* Strategic positioning ("orchestration vs infrastructure")

**Cons:**

* Maintenance burden (keep reader compatible)
* Dependency risk (if Entire shuts down)
* Format lock-in (coupled to Entire's JSONL)
* Limited value if Entire fails
* Complexity (another event source)

### Adopt Git-Native Storage (Replace PostgreSQL)

**Description**: Replace PostgreSQL event log with Git-native storage (Entire's approach).

**Pros:**

* Full compatibility with Entire (same storage model)
* Simpler infrastructure (no database required)
* Version control for events (Git history)

**Cons:**

* **Contradicts ADR 2026-02-09-1** (PostgreSQL event log foundation)
* **Breaks team SaaS**: Cannot query events efficiently (no real-time dashboard)
* **No multi-tenancy**: Git branches don't provide tenant isolation
* **No CRDT**: Cannot implement conflict resolution (requires database transactions)
* **No WebSocket sync**: Cannot subscribe to event streams
* **Wrong architecture**: Git-native is for session history (Entire's use case), NOT orchestration (Spec Kitty's use case)

### Build Own Session Capture

**Description**: Duplicate Entire's session capture infrastructure in Spec Kitty.

**Pros:**

* Full control (no dependency on Entire)
* Native integration (no import step)

**Cons:**

* **Scope creep**: Session capture is NOT Spec Kitty's core competency (we focus on orchestration)
* **Duplication of effort**: Entire already solves this (990 commits, production-ready)
* **Resource drain**: Engineering time better spent on orchestration features
* **Competitive risk**: Competing with Entire on their strength (session capture) instead of ours (orchestration)

### Ignore Entire (No Compatibility)

**Description**: Build nothing related to Entire, compete head-to-head.

**Pros:**

* Zero maintenance burden (no compatibility code)
* Simple (no additional complexity)

**Cons:**

* **Misses partnership opportunity**: No acquisition path if Entire gains traction
* **Forces user choice**: Users must pick Entire OR Spec Kitty (not both)
* **Perception risk**: "Spec Kitty ignores competitors" (not collaborative)
* **Lost learning**: Entire's session capture patterns could inform our architecture

**Partnership/Acquisition Scenarios**:

**Scenario A: Entire gains traction** (10K+ stars, funding, enterprise customers)
* Action: Reach out to Entire team (Stefan Haubold, Alex Ong)
* Proposal: Integration partnership ("Entire infrastructure + Spec Kitty orchestration")
* Acquisition estimate: $10-30M (depending on traction, revenue)

**Scenario B: Entire format breaks** (breaking changes to checkpoint JSONL)
* Action: Version EntireCheckpointReader (detect format version, handle multiple)
* Fallback: Deprecate import if maintenance burden too high

**Rollback Plan**:
* If format breaks repeatedly: Deprecate import feature (remove from CLI)
* If Entire shuts down: Archive feature (no longer maintained)
* Zero impact on core Spec Kitty flows (import is optional)
