## Dependency Rebase Guidance

Depends on **WP08** (Phase C sequential).

```bash
spec-kitty implement WP09 --base WP08
```

## Objectives & Success Criteria

- Mission template YAML configs have an `agent_role` field on task type definitions.
- Task generation reads `agent_role` and writes a suggested `agent_profile` into each generated WP frontmatter.
- `finalize-tasks` presents a confirmation step showing suggested profiles per WP.
- User can confirm, override, or skip each suggestion.
- `--json` mode skips interactive confirmation and keeps suggestions as-is.
- Suggestions do NOT block finalize-tasks if the profile doesn't exist yet.
- Requirements FR-013, FR-014, SC-002 satisfied.

## Context & Constraints

- **Plan**: `kitty-specs/057-doctrine-stack-init-and-profile-integration/plan.md` → WP-C3
- **Spec**: FR-013, FR-014, SC-002
- **Profile determination is a deterministic lookup, not content inference.** The `agent_role` hint in the template is mapped to a concrete profile name via the table below. No NLP or task-content analysis is performed. **Role-to-profile mapping**:
  - `implementer` → `implementer`
  - `reviewer` → `reviewer`
  - `planner` → `planner`
  - `researcher` → `researcher`
  - `writer` → `designer`
  - `curator` → `curator`
  - (no mapping found) → omit `agent_profile` from WP frontmatter
- **Important**: Profile suggestion is a hint, not a requirement. The profile may not exist at generation time. Resolution happens at implement time.
- **`finalize-tasks` location**: `src/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/feature.py` (look for `finalize-tasks` command, ~1481+).
- **Start command**: `spec-kitty implement WP09 --base WP08`

## Subtasks & Detailed Guidance

### Subtask T037 – Write acceptance tests (tests first)

- **Purpose**: FR-013/FR-014 scenarios must fail before implementation.
- **Files**: Create `tests/specify_cli/test_task_profile_suggestion.py`.
- **Steps**:
  1. Read `tests/specify_cli/` for existing task generation test patterns.
  2. Write 3 test functions:
     - `test_role_hint_in_mission_template` — load the software-dev mission template YAML; confirm at least one task type has an `agent_role` field.
     - `test_profile_suggested_in_generated_wp` — run task generation on a software-dev mission; check that generated WP frontmatter contains `agent_profile` field.
     - `test_finalize_tasks_shows_profile_confirmation` — simulate `finalize-tasks` on WPs with `agent_profile` suggestions; confirm the output includes a profile review step.
  3. Run `pytest tests/specify_cli/test_task_profile_suggestion.py -v` — all must FAIL.

### Subtask T038 – Add `agent_role` to mission template YAML configs

- **Purpose**: Mission templates define the expected agent role per task type. This is the source of the role hint.
- **Files**: Mission template YAML configs for all 4 missions. Find them with `find src -name "mission.yaml" -o -name "*-mission.yaml"`.
- **Steps**:
  1. Locate the mission config YAML files. They may be in `src/specify_cli/missions/*/` or `src/doctrine/missions/*/`.
  2. For each mission, add `agent_role` to task type definitions. Example for software-dev:
     ```yaml
     task_types:
       implement:
         agent_role: implementer
         description: "Implementation work packages"
       review:
         agent_role: reviewer
         description: "Code review work packages"
       plan:
         agent_role: planner
         description: "Planning work packages"
     ```
  3. If the mission config structure differs, adapt the `agent_role` placement to fit the existing schema naturally — do not force a schema change.

### Subtask T039 – Profile suggestion in task generation

- **Purpose**: When generating WP prompt files, write the suggested `agent_profile` into each WP's frontmatter using a **deterministic lookup table** — read `agent_role` from the mission template, map it to a profile name, write it. No content analysis, no heuristics.
- **Files**: The task generation code path. Locate by tracing from `spec-kitty agent feature finalize-tasks` (or the task generation command in `agent/feature.py`).
- **Steps**:
  1. Read `src/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/feature.py` around the `finalize-tasks` command (~line 1481). Understand the pipeline: tasks.md parsing → WP file creation → frontmatter population.
  2. Find where WP frontmatter is assembled during task generation or finalize-tasks.
  3. Add profile suggestion logic:
     ```python
     ROLE_TO_PROFILE = {
         "implementer": "implementer",
         "reviewer": "reviewer",
         "planner": "planner",
         "researcher": "researcher",
         "writer": "designer",
         "curator": "curator",
     }

     def suggest_profile_for_wp(wp_data: dict, mission_config: dict) -> str | None:
         """Suggest an agent_profile based on mission template agent_role hint."""
         task_type = wp_data.get("task_type") or _infer_task_type_from_title(wp_data.get("title", ""))
         role = mission_config.get("task_types", {}).get(task_type, {}).get("agent_role")
         return ROLE_TO_PROFILE.get(role) if role else None
     ```
  4. Write the suggested profile into the WP `.md` frontmatter: `agent_profile: <suggested>`. Only write if a suggestion exists.

### Subtask T040 – Profile confirmation step in `finalize-tasks`

- **Purpose**: User reviews and can override suggested profiles before they are committed.
- **Files**: `src/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/feature.py` (finalize-tasks command).
- **Steps**:
  1. After WP files are written but before the commit, add a confirmation loop if not `--json` mode:
     ```python
     if not json_mode:
         console.print("\n[bold]Agent Profile Suggestions[/bold]")
         console.print("Review suggested profiles for each work package.\n")
         for wp_file in wp_files:
             wp_id = extract_scalar(frontmatter, "work_package_id")
             suggested = extract_scalar(frontmatter, "agent_profile")
             if not suggested:
                 continue
             response = Prompt.ask(
                 f"  {wp_id}: suggested [cyan]{suggested}[/cyan] — confirm, override, or skip",
                 default="y",
             )
             if response.lower() == "y":
                 pass  # Keep suggestion
             elif response.lower() in ("n", "skip", ""):
                 # Remove agent_profile from frontmatter
                 _remove_frontmatter_field(wp_file, "agent_profile")
             else:
                 # User typed a profile name — use it
                 _update_frontmatter_field(wp_file, "agent_profile", response.strip())
     ```
  2. If `--json` mode: keep suggestions as-is without prompting.
  3. Ensure `finalize-tasks` does NOT fail if a suggested profile doesn't exist in the repo (suggestion is advisory only).

### Subtask T041 – Update mission templates with role hints

- **Purpose**: All 4 standard missions (software-dev, research, documentation, plan) should have role hints for their standard task types.
- **Files**: All 4 mission template YAMLs (located in step T038).
- **Steps**:
  1. Software-dev: implement → `implementer`, review → `reviewer`, plan → `planner`, specify → `planner`.
  2. Research: research → `researcher`, analyze → `researcher`, report → `writer`.
  3. Documentation: write → `writer`, review → `reviewer`, plan → `planner`.
  4. Plan: plan → `planner`, research → `researcher`, review → `reviewer`.
  5. Run `pytest tests/specify_cli/test_task_profile_suggestion.py -v` — all 3 tests should now pass (green).
  6. Run `pytest tests/ -x` — full suite must pass.

## Test Strategy

```bash
# ATDD acceptance tests
rtk test pytest tests/specify_cli/test_task_profile_suggestion.py -v

# Full suite regression
rtk test pytest tests/ -x

# Coverage gate (90%+ on new modules — constitution requirement)
rtk test pytest tests/ --cov=specify_cli --cov=doctrine --cov=constitution --cov-fail-under=90 -q

# Type check
mypy --strict src/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/feature.py

# Lint
rtk ruff check src/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/feature.py
```

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Mission config location**: If the mission YAML files are not where expected, use `rg -l "task_types" src/ --type yaml` to locate them.
- **`finalize-tasks` pipeline complexity**: `feature.py` is 1996 lines. Read the function structure before editing. Limit changes to the confirmation step and the profile suggestion injection.
- **WP file already has `agent_profile` manually set**: If a WP already has `agent_profile` set in frontmatter (e.g., set by the tasks template writer), do not overwrite it — only set it if absent.

## Review Guidance

- Generate tasks for a software-dev mission; check that generated WP files have `agent_profile` suggestions in their frontmatter.
- Run `finalize-tasks` and confirm the profile confirmation prompt appears (not in `--json` mode).
- Run `finalize-tasks --json` and confirm no interactive prompt.
- Verify that a missing/unresolvable suggested profile does not cause finalize-tasks to fail.

- 2026-03-25T04:13:09Z – claude – shell_pid=502315 – lane=approved – Review passed: all 3 ATDD tests pass, task_types added to all 4 mission YAMLs (both src/specify_cli and src/doctrine copies), MissionConfig schema properly extended with TaskTypeConfig, finalize-tasks integration is non-blocking. T040 uses display-only summary rather than interactive Prompt.ask, which the ATDD test explicitly validates and is pragmatically better for headless agent use.
