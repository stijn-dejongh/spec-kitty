# Work Package Prompt: WP06 – Consolidate missions-root path hardcodes

## ⚡ Do This First: Load Agent Profile

Use the `/ad-hoc-profile-load` skill to load `python-pedro` (implementer role, claude agent) before parsing
the rest of this prompt.

## Objectives & Success Criteria

Retarget the 3 duplicate missions-root hardcodes onto one promoted authority (FR-004). **This FR's original
framing changed during planning — read the Context section before starting.**

**Success criteria**:
- `builtin_missions_root()` becomes a thin delegate to `MissionTemplateRepository.default_missions_root()`,
  not a second co-equal authority.
- `runtime/home.py`'s `dev_roots` fallback tuple calls the same promoted authority.
- An equality regression test proves both retarget correctly.
- The PR description states explicitly that full convergence with `doctrine.pack_paths.built_in_dir` still
  awaits `#3091` — this WP does NOT claim that convergence.

## Context & Constraints

- **Do not** retarget onto `doctrine.pack_paths.built_in_dir` — `pack_paths` has no `missions/` content
  directory today (confirmed in `research.md` D1); that only exists after the deferred `#3091` relocation.
- `MissionTemplateRepository.default_missions_root()` (`src/doctrine/missions/repository.py:98`) is already
  correctly implemented (`importlib.resources`-based, wheel-safe) — this is the promotion target, and this
  WP does NOT modify that file.
- `builtin_missions_root()` was itself previously promoted as a shared authority (WP06/#2668 — referenced in
  comments at `charter/action_grain.py:203-204` and `charter/mission_type_profiles.py:646-647`) — this WP
  makes it a delegate, not a rival authority. Existing callers of `builtin_missions_root()` are unaffected
  by making it a delegate (same return value, different implementation).
- `home.py`'s retarget introduces a function-local import of a doctrine-layer class — this matches the
  file's own existing pattern at `home.py:49` (also function-local). Note this in T025's PR-description
  addition as a residual risk sharing `#2986`'s blind spot, not a silently different shape.
- `home.py`'s `importlib.resources` lookup step (lines 97-104, preceding the `dev_roots` fallback) is a
  fourth resolution path for the same root and is explicitly **out of scope** — only the `dev_roots` tuple is
  retargeted.
- Independent of WP01-05 — no dependency, can run in parallel.

## Branch Strategy

- **Strategy**: lane-per-WP (normalized by `finalize-tasks`)
- **Planning base branch**: feat/charter-sole-door-bypass-closure
- **Merge target branch**: feat/charter-sole-door-bypass-closure

## Subtasks & Detailed Guidance

### Subtask T022 – Make `builtin_missions_root()` a thin delegate

- **Purpose**: Close one of the 3 duplicate hardcodes, keep existing callers unaffected.
- **Steps**: Replace `builtin_missions_root()`'s body (currently
  `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]/"doctrine"/"missions"`) with
  `return MissionTemplateRepository.default_missions_root()`. Keep the function's signature and name
  unchanged — existing callers (`action_grain.py`, `mission_type_profiles.py`, others) must not need
  changes.
- **Files**: `src/charter/mission_type_profile_repository.py`.
- **Parallel?**: Yes.

### Subtask T023 – Retarget `home.py`'s `dev_roots` fallback

- **Purpose**: Close the second duplicate hardcode.
- **Steps**: In `get_package_asset_root()`, replace the `dev_roots` tuple's literal missions-root entry
  (lines 107-108) with a call to `MissionTemplateRepository.default_missions_root()`. Leave the
  `importlib.resources` lookup step preceding it (lines 97-104) untouched — that's a different resolution
  path, explicitly out of scope.
- **Files**: `src/specify_cli/runtime/home.py`.
- **Parallel?**: Yes.

### Subtask T024 – Equality regression test

- **Purpose**: Non-fakeable proof both retargeted sites resolve identically to the promoted authority.
- **Steps**: Assert `builtin_missions_root() == MissionTemplateRepository.default_missions_root()` and that
  `home.py`'s retargeted `dev_roots` entry resolves to the same path.
- **Files**: `tests/charter/test_missions_root_authority.py` (new).
- **Parallel?**: No — depends on T022, T023.

### Subtask T025 – Document the residual risk and deferred convergence in the PR description

- **Purpose**: NFR-004 requires this be stated explicitly, not implied away.
- **Steps**: Add a paragraph to the PR description (or a dedicated section in the mission tracer file) that
  states: (a) `home.py`'s function-local doctrine import matches an existing pattern in the same file and
  shares `#2986`'s blind spot — named, not hidden; (b) full convergence onto `doctrine.pack_paths.
  built_in_dir` is deferred to `#3091` and is NOT claimed by this WP.
- **Files**: PR description / mission tracer file (not a source file).
- **Parallel?**: Yes, can be drafted alongside T022-T024.

## Test Strategy

- `pytest tests/charter/ tests/specify_cli/runtime/ -v`.
- `mypy --strict src/charter/mission_type_profile_repository.py src/specify_cli/runtime/home.py`.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Retargeting onto `pack_paths.built_in_dir` by mistake** (the original, now-corrected spec framing).
  Mitigation: re-read the Context section above — the promotion target is `MissionTemplateRepository.
  default_missions_root()`, never `pack_paths`.

## Review Guidance

- Confirm neither retargeted site references `doctrine.pack_paths` at all.
- Confirm `builtin_missions_root()`'s existing callers are unaffected (no signature change).
- Confirm T025's PR-description language actually landed, not just drafted.
