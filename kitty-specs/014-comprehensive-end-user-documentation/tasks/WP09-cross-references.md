## Critical Issue: Branch Missing Content from Other WPs

WP10 (Validation & Polish) is based on an outdated branch that lacks the content created by WP03-WP09. The branch needs to be rebased/merged to include:

**Missing from tutorials/ (WP03/WP04 content):**
- `getting-started.md`
- `your-first-feature.md`
- `multi-agent-workflow.md`
- `missions-overview.md`

**Missing from how-to/ (WP05 content):**
- `create-specification.md`
- `implement-work-package.md`
- `review-work-package.md`
- `handle-dependencies.md`
- `parallel-development.md`

**Missing from reference/ (WP07 content):**
- Entire reference/ directory is empty
- All CLI and slash command references missing

**Missing from explanation/ (WP08 content):**
- `spec-driven-development.md`
- `git-worktrees.md`
- `mission-system.md`
- `kanban-workflow.md`
- `ai-agent-architecture.md`
- `divio-documentation.md`

## Root Cause

WP10 was created from WP02's branch but was not updated to include content from:
- WP03: Tutorials content
- WP04: More tutorials  
- WP05: How-to guides
- WP06: More how-to guides
- WP07: Reference documentation
- WP08: Explanations
- WP09: Cross-references and toc.yml

## Required Actions

1. **Rebase WP10 branch** to include changes from all dependent WPs:
   ```bash
   cd .worktrees/014-comprehensive-end-user-documentation-WP10
   git fetch origin
   git rebase 014-comprehensive-end-user-documentation-WP09
   ```
   (Or merge from WP09 which should have all prior work)

2. **Re-run validation** after rebase:
   - Test DocFX build
   - Verify all links work
   - Check terminology consistency
   - Verify success criteria

The current state cannot be approved because validation was performed on incomplete documentation.

## Objectives & Success Criteria

- Add cross-references between all documentation files
- Ensure no broken internal links
- **Success**: Every doc has relevant cross-references, all links work

## Context & Constraints

- **Spec**: `kitty-specs/014-comprehensive-end-user-documentation/spec.md`
- **Plan**: `kitty-specs/014-comprehensive-end-user-documentation/plan.md`
- **Dependencies**: All content WPs must be complete (WP03-WP08)

### Cross-Reference Principles

- Each tutorial should link to related how-tos and reference docs
- Each how-to should link to related reference and explanations
- Each explanation should link back to tutorials and how-tos
- Use relative paths for internal links

## Subtasks & Detailed Guidance

### Subtask T038 – Add Cross-References to Tutorials

- **Purpose**: Connect tutorials to related practical guides
- **Steps**:
  1. For each tutorial in `docs/tutorials/`:
     - Add "Related How-To Guides" section
     - Add "Reference Documentation" section
     - Add "Learn More" section with explanations
  2. Example additions:
     ```markdown
     ## Related How-To Guides
     - [Create a Specification](../how-to/create-specification.md)
     - [Implement a Work Package](../how-to/implement-work-package.md)

     ## Reference
     - [CLI Commands](../reference/cli-commands.md)
     - [Slash Commands](../reference/slash-commands.md)

     ## Learn More
     - [Spec-Driven Development](../explanation/spec-driven-development.md)
     ```
- **Files**: All files in `docs/tutorials/`
- **Parallel?**: Yes

### Subtask T039 – Add Cross-References to How-To Guides

- **Purpose**: Connect how-tos to reference and conceptual content
- **Steps**:
  1. For each how-to in `docs/how-to/`:
     - Add "Command Reference" section linking to relevant commands
     - Add "See Also" section for related how-tos
     - Add "Background" section linking to explanations
  2. Example:
     ```markdown
     ## Command Reference
     - [`spec-kitty implement`](../reference/cli-commands.md#spec-kitty-implement)
     - [`/spec-kitty.implement`](../reference/slash-commands.md#spec-kittyimplement)

     ## See Also
     - [Handle Dependencies](handle-dependencies.md)
     - [Parallel Development](parallel-development.md)

     ## Background
     - [Git Worktrees Explained](../explanation/git-worktrees.md)
     - [Workspace-per-WP Model](../explanation/workspace-per-wp.md)
     ```
- **Files**: All files in `docs/how-to/`
- **Parallel?**: Yes

### Subtask T040 – Add Cross-References to Reference Docs

- **Purpose**: Connect reference docs to practical usage guides
- **Steps**:
  1. For each reference doc in `docs/reference/`:
     - Add "Getting Started" links to tutorials
     - Add "Practical Usage" links to how-tos
  2. Example in cli-commands.md:
     ```markdown
     ## spec-kitty implement
     ...
     **See Also**:
     - Tutorial: [Your First Feature](../tutorials/your-first-feature.md)
     - How-To: [Implement a Work Package](../how-to/implement-work-package.md)
     ```
- **Files**: All files in `docs/reference/`
- **Parallel?**: Yes

### Subtask T041 – Add Cross-References to Explanations

- **Purpose**: Connect conceptual content to practical guides
- **Steps**:
  1. For each explanation in `docs/explanation/`:
     - Add "Try It" section linking to tutorials
     - Add "How-To Guides" for practical application
     - Add "Reference" for detailed command info
  2. Example:
     ```markdown
     ## Try It
     - [Multi-Agent Workflow Tutorial](../tutorials/multi-agent-workflow.md)

     ## How-To Guides
     - [Parallel Development](../how-to/parallel-development.md)
     - [Handle Dependencies](../how-to/handle-dependencies.md)

     ## Reference
     - [File Structure](../reference/file-structure.md)
     ```
- **Files**: All files in `docs/explanation/`
- **Parallel?**: Yes

### Subtask T042 – Verify All Internal Links

- **Purpose**: Ensure no broken links in the documentation
- **Steps**:
  1. Use a link checker tool or manual verification
  2. Check all relative paths are correct
  3. Verify anchor links (e.g., `#spec-kitty-implement`) exist
  4. Fix any broken links found
  5. Options for verification:
     ```bash
     # Option 1: DocFX build (warns about missing files)
     docfx docs/docfx.json

     # Option 2: Grep for markdown links
     grep -r '\[.*\](.*\.md' docs/

     # Option 3: Use a link checker tool
     ```
- **Files**: All files in `docs/`
- **Parallel?**: No - run after T038-T041
- **Notes**: Important for user experience

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Broken links | Use DocFX build warnings |
| Missing cross-refs | Systematic review of each file |
| Circular references | Keep links hierarchical |

## Definition of Done Checklist

- [ ] T038: All tutorials have cross-references

- [ ] T040: All reference docs have cross-references
- [ ] T041: All explanations have cross-references
- [ ] T042: All internal links verified working
- [ ] No broken links in DocFX build

## Review Guidance

- Check that cross-references are relevant (not just link spam)
- Verify relative paths are correct
- Test links by clicking through documentation
