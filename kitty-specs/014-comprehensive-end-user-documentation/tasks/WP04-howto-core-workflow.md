## Objectives & Success Criteria

- Create 7 task-oriented how-to guides for the core spec-kitty workflow
- Each guide focuses on ONE specific task
- **Success**: User can follow any guide to accomplish the specific task

## Context & Constraints

- **Spec**: `kitty-specs/014-comprehensive-end-user-documentation/spec.md`
- **Plan**: `kitty-specs/014-comprehensive-end-user-documentation/plan.md`
- **Divio Type**: How-To = task-oriented, problem-solving

### How-To Principles (from Divio)

- How-tos are **goal-oriented**
- Focus on a specific, practical goal
- Don't explain concepts (link to explanations)
- Provide working solutions
- Be flexible for different situations

## Subtasks & Detailed Guidance

### Subtask T012 – Create install-and-upgrade.md

- **Purpose**: How to install spec-kitty and upgrade existing projects
- **Structure**:
  ```markdown
  # How to Install and Upgrade Spec Kitty

  [spec-kitty --version]
  ```
- **Files**: `docs/how-to/install-and-upgrade.md`
- **Parallel?**: Yes

### Subtask T013 – Create create-specification.md

- **Purpose**: How to use /spec-kitty.specify
- **Structure**:
  ```markdown
  # How to Create a Feature Specification

  ## When to Use
  [Starting a new feature]

  ## The Command
  ```bash
  /spec-kitty.specify <description>
  ```

  ## The Discovery Interview

  [WAITING_FOR_DISCOVERY_INPUT explained]

  ## What Gets Created

  [kitty-specs/###-feature/spec.md]

  ## Example

  [Complete walkthrough]

  ## Troubleshooting

  [Common issues]
  ```

  ## The Command
  ```bash
  /spec-kitty.tasks
  ```

  ## What Gets Created

  - tasks.md (overview)
  - tasks/WP01-xxx.md, tasks/WP02-xxx.md (prompt files)

  ## Understanding Work Packages

  ## Example Output

  ```
- **Files**: `docs/how-to/generate-tasks.md`
- **Parallel?**: Yes

### Subtask T016 – Create implement-work-package.md

- **Purpose**: How to use spec-kitty implement and /spec-kitty.implement
- **Structure**:
  ```markdown
  # How to Implement a Work Package

  ## Prerequisites
  [tasks must be generated and finalized]

  ## Create the Workspace
  ```bash
  spec-kitty implement WP01
  ```

  ## With Dependencies

  spec-kitty implement WP02 --base WP01
  ```

  ## What Happens

  - Creates .worktrees/###-feature-WP01/
  - Creates git branch
  - Moves WP to "doing" lane

  ## Working in the Workspace
