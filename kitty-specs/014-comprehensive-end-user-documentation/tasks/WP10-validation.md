## Critical Issue: Branch Missing Content from Other WPs

WP10 (Validation & Polish) is based on an outdated branch that lacks the content created by WP03-WP09. The branch needs to be rebased/merged to include:

**Missing from tutorials/ (WP03/WP04 content):**
- `getting-started.md`
- `your-first-feature.md`
- `multi-agent-workflow.md`
- `missions-overview.md`

**Missing from how-to/ (WP05 content):**
- `create-specification.md`
- `implement-work-package.md`
- `review-work-package.md`
- `handle-dependencies.md`
- `parallel-development.md`

**Missing from reference/ (WP07 content):**
- Entire reference/ directory is empty
- All CLI and slash command references missing

**Missing from explanation/ (WP08 content):**
- `spec-driven-development.md`
- `git-worktrees.md`
- `mission-system.md`
- `kanban-workflow.md`
- `ai-agent-architecture.md`
- `divio-documentation.md`

## Root Cause

WP10 was created from WP02's branch but was not updated to include content from:
- WP03: Tutorials content
- WP04: More tutorials  
- WP05: How-to guides
- WP06: More how-to guides
- WP07: Reference documentation
- WP08: Explanations
- WP09: Cross-references and toc.yml

## Required Actions

1. **Rebase WP10 branch** to include changes from all dependent WPs:
   ```bash
   cd .worktrees/014-comprehensive-end-user-documentation-WP10
   git fetch origin
   git rebase 014-comprehensive-end-user-documentation-WP09
   ```
   (Or merge from WP09 which should have all prior work)

2. **Re-run validation** after rebase:
   - Test DocFX build
   - Verify all links work
   - Check terminology consistency
   - Verify success criteria

The current state cannot be approved because validation was performed on incomplete documentation.

## Objectives & Success Criteria

- Validate DocFX builds successfully
- Verify all content meets quality standards
- Final polish and consistency check
- **Success**: Documentation builds without errors, all success criteria from spec.md met

## Context & Constraints

- **Spec**: `kitty-specs/014-comprehensive-end-user-documentation/spec.md`
- **Plan**: `kitty-specs/014-comprehensive-end-user-documentation/plan.md`
- **Dependencies**: All content and cross-reference WPs must be complete (WP01-WP09)

### Success Criteria from Spec

- SC-001: New user can complete Getting Started tutorial in 30 minutes
- SC-002: Find answers within 3 clicks from landing page
- SC-003: 100% of slash commands documented
- SC-004: Each major feature has 2+ Divio types
- SC-005: Zero outdated information
- SC-006: All tutorials testable end-to-end

## Subtasks & Detailed Guidance

### Subtask T043 – Test DocFX Build

- **Purpose**: Ensure documentation builds without errors
- **Steps**:
  1. Install DocFX if needed:
     ```bash
     dotnet tool install -g docfx
     ```
  2. Run DocFX build:
     ```bash
     cd /Users/robert/Code/spec-kitty
     docfx docs/docfx.json
     ```
  3. Check for errors (not just warnings)
  4. Review build output for issues
  5. Preview locally:
     ```bash
     docfx serve docs/_site
     ```
  6. Navigate through all sections in browser
- **Files**: `docs/docfx.json`, `docs/_site/`
- **Parallel?**: No - must complete first
- **Notes**: Do NOT commit _site/ directory

### Subtask T044 – Verify All Links Work

- **Purpose**: Final link verification
- **Steps**:
  1. Internal links: Already checked in WP09, but verify again
  2. External links: Check any external URLs still work
  3. Anchor links: Verify #section links resolve
  4. Use browser developer tools or link checker
  5. Fix any broken links found
- **Files**: All `docs/**/*.md`
- **Parallel?**: Yes - can run with T045
- **Notes**: Pay attention to relative path issues

### Subtask T045 – Review Consistency

- **Purpose**: Ensure consistent tone, formatting, terminology
- **Steps**:
  1. **Terminology check**:
     - "Work Package" vs "WP" (be consistent)
     - "spec-kitty" vs "Spec Kitty" vs "spec-kitty-cli"
     - "slash command" vs "command"
  2. **Formatting check**:
     - Code blocks have language specified
     - Commands use consistent style
     - Headers follow hierarchy
  3. **Tone check**:
     - Professional but approachable
     - Active voice preferred
     - No unnecessary jargon
  4. Fix inconsistencies found
- **Files**: All `docs/**/*.md`
- **Parallel?**: Yes - can run with T044
- **Notes**: Create a style guide if patterns emerge

### Subtask T046 – Update docfx.json

- **Purpose**: Ensure DocFX config is correct for new structure
- **Steps**:
  1. Review `docs/docfx.json`:
     - Verify content globs include new directories
     - Check template settings
     - Verify metadata is correct
  2. Update if needed:
     ```json
     {
       "build": {
         "content": [
           {
             "files": [
               "*.md",
               "tutorials/*.md",
               "how-to/*.md",
               "reference/*.md",
               "explanation/*.md",
               "toc.yml"
             ]
           }
         ]
       }
     }
     ```
  3. Test build after any changes
- **Files**: `docs/docfx.json`
- **Parallel?**: No - must be done carefully
- **Notes**: Backup before changes

### Subtask T047 – Final Review Against Spec

- **Purpose**: Verify all success criteria from spec.md are met
- **Steps**:
  1. Review each success criterion:

     **SC-001**: Getting Started tutorial < 30 min
     - [ ] Walk through tutorial yourself
     - [ ] Time the experience
     - [ ] Verify a new user could complete it

     **SC-002**: 3 clicks from landing page
     - [ ] Test navigation paths
     - [ ] Common questions findable quickly

     **SC-003**: 100% slash commands documented
     - [ ] Count commands in reference/slash-commands.md
     - [ ] Verify against actual command list (14)

     **SC-004**: Major features have 2+ Divio types
     - [ ] Installation: How-To ✓, Tutorial ✓
     - [ ] Workflow: Tutorial ✓, How-To ✓
     - [ ] Commands: Reference ✓, How-To ✓

     **SC-005**: Zero outdated information
     - [ ] Spot check commands against --help
     - [ ] Verify 0.11.0 model described correctly

     **SC-006**: Tutorials testable
     - [ ] Run through each tutorial
     - [ ] Verify commands produce expected output

  2. Document any gaps
  3. Fix any issues found
- **Files**: All documentation
- **Parallel?**: No - final check
- **Notes**: This is the final quality gate
