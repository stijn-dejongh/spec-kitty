## Review Feedback

**Reviewed by**: Robert Douglass
**Status**: ❌ Changes Requested
**Date**: 2026-01-16

**Issue 1: Landing page exceeds required length**
- WP02 requires `docs/index.md` to be < 100 lines. Current file is 108 lines.
Please shorten the landing page to under 100 lines (e.g., trim the Quick Start block or compress sections) while keeping logo and dashboard images.

**Issue 2: DocFX build verification missing**
- T007 requires verifying `docfx docs/docfx.json` builds without errors (warnings OK). The activity log notes DocFX was not installed and the build was not run.
Please run the DocFX build and confirm it succeeds, or document any errors and fix them.

## Objectives & Success Criteria

- Rewrite `docs/index.md` as a clean, concise landing page
- Update `docs/toc.yml` for Divio 4-type navigation structure
- Verify DocFX builds successfully with new structure
- **Success**: Landing page renders correctly, navigation works, DocFX builds without errors

## Context & Constraints

- **Spec**: `kitty-specs/014-comprehensive-end-user-documentation/spec.md`
- **Plan**: `kitty-specs/014-comprehensive-end-user-documentation/plan.md`
- **Current index.md**: 869 lines - WAY too long, tries to be everything
- **Target**: < 100 lines, focused on navigation and value proposition

### Design Principles

- Landing page should answer: "What is spec-kitty and where do I start?"
- Clear navigation to all 4 Divio sections
- Keep dashboard screenshots and logo (they're valuable)
- Remove tutorial/reference content (belongs in other sections)

## Subtasks & Detailed Guidance

### Subtask T005 – Rewrite index.md as Landing Page

- **Purpose**: Create a focused entry point that guides users to the right content
- **Steps**:
  1. Create new `docs/index.md` with structure:
     ```markdown
     # Spec Kitty Documentation

     [Logo and tagline]

     ## What is Spec Kitty?
     [2-3 sentences explaining value proposition]

     ## Quick Navigation

     ### 📚 Tutorials (Learning)

     ## Dashboard Preview
     [Keep existing dashboard screenshots]
     ```
  2. Keep the logo and dashboard images
  3. Remove all tutorial/reference content (move to appropriate sections)
- **Files**: `docs/index.md`
- **Parallel?**: No - defines navigation for all other WPs
- **Notes**: Links can point to files that don't exist yet (they'll be created in WP03-WP08)

### Subtask T006 – Update toc.yml for Divio Structure

- **Purpose**: Configure DocFX navigation for 4-type documentation
- **Steps**:
  1. Rewrite `docs/toc.yml` with structure:
     ```yaml
     - name: Home
       href: index.md

     - name: Tutorials
       items:
         - name: Getting Started
           href: tutorials/getting-started.md
         - name: Your First Feature
           href: tutorials/your-first-feature.md
         - name: Missions Overview
           href: tutorials/missions-overview.md
         - name: Multi-Agent Workflow
           href: tutorials/multi-agent-workflow.md

     - name: How-To Guides
       items:
         - name: Install & Upgrade
           href: how-to/install-and-upgrade.md
         # ... all how-to guides

     - name: Reference
       items:
         - name: CLI Commands
           href: reference/cli-commands.md
         # ... all reference docs

     - name: Explanations
       items:
         - name: Spec-Driven Development
           href: explanation/spec-driven-development.md
         # ... all explanations
     ```
  2. Include ALL planned documentation files (even if not created yet)
  3. Order items logically within each section
- **Files**: `docs/toc.yml`
- **Parallel?**: No - must be done with T005
- **Notes**: DocFX will warn about missing files but will build

### Subtask T007 – Verify DocFX Build

- **Purpose**: Ensure the new structure works with DocFX
- **Steps**:
  1. Install DocFX if not available: `dotnet tool install -g docfx`
  2. Run build: `docfx docs/docfx.json`
  3. Check for errors (warnings about missing files are OK)
  4. Preview locally: `docfx serve docs/_site`
  5. Verify navigation renders correctly
- **Files**: `docs/docfx.json`, `docs/_site/`
- **Parallel?**: No - must run after T005, T006
- **Notes**: Don't commit `_site/` directory

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| DocFX config incompatibility | Test build before committing |
| Missing file warnings | Expected - files created in WP03-WP08 |
| Broken navigation | Preview locally before commit |
