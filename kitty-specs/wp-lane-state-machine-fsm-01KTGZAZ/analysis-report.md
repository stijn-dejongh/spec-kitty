# Specification Analysis Report — wp-lane-state-machine-fsm-01KTGZAZ

**Generated:** 2026-06-07 · **Artifacts:** spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md · **Charter:** `.kittify/charter/charter.md`
**Verdict: READY — 0 critical.** Coverage 22/22 FRs (100%); spec↔plan↔tasks coherent; both plan decisions resolved.

## Coverage Summary

- **FR coverage: 22/22 (FR-001..FR-022) mapped to a WP; no orphans, no unknown refs.** Verified at `finalize-tasks --validate-only` (passed) and by direct grep.
- IC→WP: IC-01→WP01, IC-02→WP02, IC-03→WP03, IC-04→WP04, IC-05→WP05, IC-06→WP06. NFR-001/002/004→WP01; NFR-003→WP06; NFR-005→WP04. C-001..C-005 placed.
- Decisions DM-01KTH03G (full guard/force ownership) and DM-01KTH03H (`spec_kitty_events` enum bump) are resolved and reflected in FR-012, FR-010/011, C-004.

## Findings

| ID | Category | Severity | Location | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|----------|---------|----------------|
| R1 | External dependency | **HIGH (risk, not defect)** | WP04 / FR-010 / C-004 | WP04's T019/T020 require an external `spec_kitty_events` release (add `genesis` to its `Lane`) via the owning-package workflow. The implement loop cannot *complete* WP04 in-repo until that release ships. | Sequence WP04 to land after the upstream release; until then, the CLI side (T021/T022 + compat gate) can proceed and degrade gracefully. The loop should flag WP04 as blocked-on-external rather than improvise a path/editable override (Shared Package Boundary charter). |
| R2 | Sequencing | MEDIUM | WP01 vs WP02 | The baseline `_derive_from_lane→GENESIS` is live, but read-side parity (WP02) is not yet done. Between WP01 and WP02, correctness relies on `finalize-tasks` seeding every WP to `planned` (now guaranteed by the merged clobber fix). | Keep WP01→WP02 on the critical path; do not defer WP02. (Already encoded as deps.) |
| O1 | Operational note | INFO | both branches | The tasks artifacts are committed to BOTH `mission/wp-lane-state-machine-fsm` and the coordination branch (deliberate, for a self-contained mission branch). Benign duplication; the coord branch remains the runtime authority. | None. |
| T1 | Terminology | LOW | spec/plan | "genesis (non-display)" and "single source of transition truth" used consistently; no `feature*` drift. | None. |

## Charter alignment

- **Shared Package Boundary** — WP04 explicitly follows the owning-package workflow (no committed overrides). PASS.
- **ATDD-First (C-011)** — WP01 carries a behavior-preservation parity gate authored RED-first. PASS (planned).
- **Test/Typecheck Quality Gate** — every WP requires `ruff`+`mypy` clean. PASS (planned).
- **Burn-down / single-ownership** — the change *removes* the dual-source matrix and forbids a derived-constant gate (FR-021/022). PASS (planned).

## Metrics

- User Stories: 8 · FRs: 22 · NFRs: 5 · Constraints: 5 · WPs: 6 · Subtasks: 31 · Lanes: 6
- FR coverage: 100% · Duplication: 0 · Ambiguity: 0 (both decisions resolved) · **Critical: 0**

## Next Actions

READY to implement. Start at **WP01** (foundation; gates WP02/03/04/06). **WP04 is blocked on an external `spec_kitty_events` release** — implement its in-repo parts and flag the external item rather than work around the package boundary.
