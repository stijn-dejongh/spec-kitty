# Work Packages: Autonomous Multi-Agent Orchestration Research

**Inputs**: Design documents from `/kitty-specs/019-autonomous-multi-agent-orchestration-research/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (research methodology), spec.md (research questions), data-model.md (schema templates), quickstart.md (CLI testing guide)

**Mission**: Research (no code implementation)

**Organization**: Fine-grained subtasks (`Txxx`) roll up into work packages (`WPxx`). Each work package produces research artifacts that feed into synthesis phases.

**Parallelization Note**: WP01-WP05 are **fully independent** and can run simultaneously. WP06-WP08 have dependencies and must run sequentially after their prerequisites complete.

## Subtask Format: `[Txxx] [P?] Description`

- **[P]** indicates the subtask can proceed in parallel (different agents/concerns).
- File paths reference `research/XX-agent-name.md` for individual findings.

## Work Package WP01: Research Known CLI Agents (Priority: P1) [P]

**Goal**: Investigate the 4 agents with known CLI tools: Claude Code, GitHub Codex, OpenCode, Amazon Q.
**Independent Test**: Each agent has a completed research file with working CLI commands verified locally.
**Prompt**: `tasks/WP01-research-known-cli-agents.md`

### Included Subtasks

- [x] T001 [P] Research Claude Code CLI - docs, install, `claude --help`, test invocation
- [x] T002 [P] Research GitHub Codex CLI - docs, install, `codex --help`, test invocation
- [x] T003 [P] Research OpenCode CLI - docs, install, `opencode --help`, test invocation
- [x] T004 [P] Research Amazon Q CLI - docs, install, `q --help`, test invocation
- [x] T005 Write research files: `research/01-claude-code.md`, `research/08-github-codex.md`, `research/06-opencode.md`, `research/12-amazon-q.md`

### Implementation Notes

- Follow research template from plan.md for each agent
- All 4 agents can be researched in parallel
- Must include: CLI availability, task specification method, completion detection, parallel constraints
- Local testing required: run `--help`, `--version`, and basic prompt

### Parallel Opportunities

- All 4 agents are independent - T001-T004 can run simultaneously

### Dependencies

- None (starting package)

### Risks & Mitigations

- CLI may require paid subscription → document free tier limitations
- Auth tokens needed → document setup without storing secrets

## Work Package WP02: Research Cursor CLI (Priority: P1 - User Priority) [P]

**Goal**: Specifically investigate Cursor's CLI capabilities as requested by user.
**Independent Test**: Cursor CLI documented with working invocation example or confirmed as IDE-only.
**Prompt**: `tasks/WP02-research-cursor-cli.md`

### Included Subtasks

- [x] T006 Search for Cursor CLI documentation and installation
- [x] T007 Check Cursor.app for embedded CLI tools (macOS: `/Applications/Cursor.app/Contents/Resources/`)
- [x] T008 Test `cursor --help` or equivalent command
- [x] T009 Document headless invocation method if available
- [x] T010 Write research file: `research/04-cursor.md`

### Implementation Notes

- User specifically requested finding Cursor's CLI
- Check if Cursor has shell command integration like VS Code (`cursor .`)
- Investigate agent mode capabilities vs basic editor commands
- If CLI exists, document full task specification method

### Parallel Opportunities

- T006-T009 are sequential investigation steps

### Dependencies

- None (independent research)

### Risks & Mitigations

- Cursor may be IDE-only → document API alternatives if available
- CLI may be undocumented → test empirically and note unofficial status

## Work Package WP03: Research IDE-Primary Agents (Priority: P2) [P]

**Goal**: Investigate GitHub Copilot and Windsurf (Codeium) for headless CLI options.
**Independent Test**: Both agents have completed research files documenting CLI availability or IDE-only status.
**Prompt**: `tasks/WP03-research-ide-agents.md`

### Included Subtasks

- [x] T011 [P] Research GitHub Copilot - check for `gh copilot` extension, API access
- [x] T012 [P] Research Windsurf/Codeium - check for `codeium` CLI, language server headless mode
- [x] T013 Document any headless workarounds (API calls, extension CLIs)
- [x] T014 Write research files: `research/02-github-copilot.md`, `research/07-windsurf.md`

### Implementation Notes

- Both are primarily IDE extensions, likely limited headless support
- Check GitHub CLI (`gh`) for Copilot extension capabilities
- Codeium has language server that might run headless

### Parallel Opportunities

- T011 and T012 can run simultaneously

### Dependencies

- None (independent research)

### Risks & Mitigations

- May be IDE-only → document and move on
- API-only access may have different rate limits

---

## Work Package WP04: Research Cloud/API Agents (Priority: P2) [P]

**Goal**: Investigate Google Gemini and Qwen Code for CLI/API access.
**Independent Test**: Both agents have completed research files with CLI or API invocation methods.
**Prompt**: `tasks/WP04-research-cloud-agents.md`

### Included Subtasks

- [x] T015 [P] Research Google Gemini - check for `gemini` CLI, `gcloud ai` commands, API SDK
- [x] T016 [P] Research Qwen Code - check Alibaba Cloud CLI, DashScope API, any standalone tools
- [x] T017 Document cloud authentication requirements for each
- [x] T018 Write research files: `research/03-google-gemini.md`, `research/05-qwen-code.md`

### Implementation Notes

- Both likely require cloud SDK or direct API calls
- Check for official CLI wrappers or third-party tools
- Document API endpoint structure if no CLI exists

### Parallel Opportunities

- T015 and T016 can run simultaneously

### Dependencies

- None (independent research)

### Risks & Mitigations

- May require cloud account setup → document requirements
- API-only may need wrapper script for orchestration

---

## Work Package WP05: Research VS Code Extensions (Priority: P2) [P]

**Goal**: Investigate Kilocode, Augment Code, and Roo Cline for headless capabilities.
**Independent Test**: All 3 agents have completed research files documenting capabilities.
**Prompt**: `tasks/WP05-research-vscode-extensions.md`

### Included Subtasks

- [x] T019 [P] Research Kilocode - check for CLI, API, extension command interface
- [x] T020 [P] Research Augment Code - check for CLI, API, headless mode
- [x] T021 [P] Research Roo Cline - check Cline project for CLI, fork differences
- [x] T022 Document VS Code extension command patterns if applicable
- [x] T023 Write research files: `research/09-kilocode.md`, `research/10-augment-code.md`, `research/11-roo-cline.md`

### Implementation Notes

- All three are VS Code extensions - may share patterns
- Roo Cline is a fork of Cline - check original project for CLI
- Look for `@command` patterns or task file conventions

### Parallel Opportunities

- T019, T020, T021 can run simultaneously

### Dependencies

- None (independent research)

### Risks & Mitigations

- Extensions typically IDE-only → document and note for orchestration limitations
- May need VS Code extension host to run → document as limitation
