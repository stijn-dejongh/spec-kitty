# Work Package Prompt: WP04 – Documentation and Secret Hygiene

## Objectives & Success Criteria

- Publish clear, actionable documentation guiding maintainers through branch readiness, tagging, secret management, and token rotation.
- Ensure README newcomers immediately understand the automated pipeline and how to configure `PYPI_API_TOKEN`.
- Keep documentation aligned with workflows built in WP01–WP03.

## Context & Constraints

- Base content on `docs/releases/readiness-checklist.md`, `quickstart.md`, and plan commitments.
- Respect security requirements—no secrets or token values in docs; provide UI navigation rather than screenshots containing sensitive info.
- Link to GitHub Actions workflows and validator CLI to keep instructions cohesive.

## Subtasks & Detailed Guidance

### Subtask T007 – Expand documentation set

- **Purpose**: Provide long-form guidance referenced by workflows and readiness summaries.
- **Steps**:
  1. Update `docs/index.md` with a new section (e.g., “Automated PyPI Releases”) referencing the readiness checklist and quickstart.
  2. Modify `docs/toc.yml` to include `releases/readiness-checklist.md`.
  3. Refine `docs/releases/readiness-checklist.md` with latest workflow names, validator commands, and failure remediation (e.g., how to rotate tokens, fetch tags).
  4. Update `scripts/release/README.md` to describe validator usage (`--mode tag`, `--mode branch`), integration in workflows, and local dry-run instructions.
  5. Cross-link to relevant spec sections (FR-006 secret hygiene).
- **Files**:
  - `docs/index.md`
  - `docs/toc.yml`
  - `docs/releases/readiness-checklist.md`
  - `scripts/release/README.md`
- **Parallel?**: Yes; can iterate while workflows stabilize, but keep details consistent with YAML.
- **Notes**:
  - Use absolute URLs for PyPI references.
  - Document rotation cadence and note to record the date in checklist.

### Subtask T008 – Update README release guidance

- **Purpose**: Provide succinct onboarding for automated releases and secret setup.
- **Steps**:
  1. Add “Releasing to PyPI” section to `README.md` (or expand existing content) summarizing pipeline flow (branch readiness → merge → tag).
  2. Include step-by-step instructions for creating `PYPI_API_TOKEN` and storing it as a GitHub secret, referencing quickstart for detail.
  3. Describe how to run the validator locally and mention the guard workflows (pre-merge, protect-main).
  4. Link to `docs/releases/readiness-checklist.md` and `kitty-specs/002-lightweight-pypi-release/quickstart.md` for deep dives.
  5. Note branch protection expectations and failure remediation steps from guard workflow messages.
- **Files**:
  - `README.md`
- **Parallel?**: Yes; may commence after workflow names finalised.
- **Notes**:
  - Keep README concise; offload long instructions to docs but ensure critical steps remain.
  - Provide command snippets `git tag vX.Y.Z` and `git push origin vX.Y.Z`.

## Test Strategy

- Perform Markdown linting if available and ensure doc site builds (if doc tooling present).
- Manually follow documentation instructions to confirm they map to actual workflows.

## Risks & Mitigations

- Docs drifting from automation behavior → include references to workflow file paths so future changes remain discoverable.
- Secret creation instructions out-of-date due to GitHub UI changes → date the guidance or link to official GitHub docs.

## Definition of Done Checklist

- [ ] Docs index, TOC, readiness checklist, and script README updated with final workflow details.
- [ ] README outlines release process and secret handling succinctly with links to detailed docs.
- [ ] Documentation aligns with validator options and workflow names.
- [ ] No sensitive data introduced; all instructions reference secure storage.
- [ ] `tasks.md` updated with status change.

## Review Guidance

- Confirm docs correctly cite workflow filenames and CLI commands.
- Ensure instructions satisfy FR-001 (documented feature branch workflow) and FR-006 (secret hygiene).
- Verify README remains approachable while pointing to deeper resources.
