# Tasks Directory

This directory contains work package (WP) prompt files.

## Directory Structure (v0.9.0+)

```
tasks/
├── WP01-setup-infrastructure.md
├── WP02-user-authentication.md
├── WP03-api-endpoints.md
└── README.md
```

All WP files are stored flat in `tasks/`. Status is tracked in `status.events.jsonl`, not in WP frontmatter.

## Work Package File Format

Each WP file **MUST** use YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
work_package_id: "WP01"
title: "Work Package Title"
dependencies: []
<<<<<<<< HEAD:kitty-specs/execution-state-canonical-surface-01KTG6P9/tasks/README.md

# Work Package Prompt: WP01 – Work Package Title

```

## Status Tracking

Status is tracked via the canonical event log (`status.events.jsonl`), not in WP frontmatter.
Use `spec-kitty agent tasks move-task` to change WP status:

```bash
spec-kitty agent tasks move-task <WPID> --to <lane>
```

Example:
```bash
spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP01 --to doing
```

## File Naming

- Format: `WP01-kebab-case-slug.md`
- Examples: `WP01-setup-infrastructure.md`, `WP02-user-auth.md`
