## ⚡ Do This First: Load Agent Profile

```
/ad-hoc-profile-load python-pedro
```

You are Python Pedro. Your role is clean, well-typed Python implementation. Test sanity is non-negotiable: tests use real fixture projects with `os.utime`-bumped mtimes; no mocks of `scan_all_features` or the filesystem. Per mission-wide rule C-003.

## Objective

Implement `MissionRegistry` and `WorkPackageRegistry` as the **single sanctioned reader** for mission/WP data. Mtime-cached. Pydantic-free dataclass return types (records are stable internal Python contracts independent of the FastAPI Pydantic surface). Comprehensive edge-case unit tests covering the four explicit cases from spec § Edge cases (stale daemon mutation, identical-mtime drift, concurrent writes, missing meta.json).

## Context

The contract is fully specified in:
- `kitty-specs/mission-registry-and-api-boundary-doctrine-01KQPDBB/data-model.md` — type signatures + invariants
- `kitty-specs/mission-registry-and-api-boundary-doctrine-01KQPDBB/contracts/registry-interface.md` — public method contracts + cache behaviour

Read both before writing code. The contract is the source of truth; this WP implements it.

The registry wraps the existing scanner (`specify_cli.dashboard.scanner`) — it is NOT a rewrite. `MissionRegistry.list_missions()` calls `scan_all_features` once, transforms the result into `MissionRecord` instances, and caches. Subsequent calls hit the cache. The cache stale-check is a 3-stat-call composite key per spec FR-002.

**The registry MUST NOT reimplement scanning logic**. If `scan_all_features` has a bug, fix it in the scanner — don't paper over it in the registry.

## Subtasks

### T007 — Dataclasses

**File**: `src/dashboard/services/registry.py` (new file).

**Action**: declare the four dataclasses per `data-model.md`:

- `MissionRecord` — frozen dataclass; full field list from data-model.md.
- `WorkPackageRecord` — frozen dataclass.
- `LaneCounts` — frozen dataclass; 10 fields.
- `CacheEntry[T]` — frozen generic dataclass; private (single underscore prefix not required, but document as internal).

Use `from __future__ import annotations` for forward refs. Type-annotate every field. Use `tuple[str, ...]` for immutable sequence fields (`dependencies`, `requirement_refs`).

**Key invariant**: every record is `frozen=True`. A consumer that holds a record after the cache invalidates still sees the snapshot from the cache time (TOCTOU safety per data-model.md).

### T008 — `MissionRegistry` implementation

**File**: same as T007.

**Action**: implement `MissionRegistry` per `contracts/registry-interface.md`:

```python
class MissionRegistry:
    def __init__(self, project_dir: Path) -> None:
        self._project_dir = project_dir.resolve()
        self._cache: dict[str, CacheEntry[MissionRecord]] = {}
        self._list_cache: CacheEntry[list[MissionRecord]] | None = None
        self._wp_registries: WeakValueDictionary[str, WorkPackageRegistry] = WeakValueDictionary()
        self._lock = threading.Lock()

    def list_missions(self) -> list[MissionRecord]:
        cache_key = self._compute_list_cache_key()
        if self._list_cache and self._list_cache.cache_key == cache_key:
            return self._list_cache.value  # cache hit
        # cache miss: re-scan
        with self._lock:
            ...

    def _compute_list_cache_key(self) -> tuple[int, int, str]:
        """Triple: (mtime_ns of kitty-specs/, count of dirent entries, hash of sorted dirent names)."""
        kitty_specs = self._project_dir / "kitty-specs"
        if not kitty_specs.exists():
            return (0, 0, "")
        stat = kitty_specs.stat()
        dirents = sorted(p.name for p in kitty_specs.iterdir())
        names_hash = hashlib.sha256(b"\n".join(name.encode() for name in dirents)).hexdigest()[:16]
        return (stat.st_mtime_ns, len(dirents), names_hash)
```

Implement all four public methods (`list_missions`, `get_mission`, `workpackages_for`, `invalidate_all`).

**Performance contract** (NFR-001..003):
- Warm-cache `list_missions()`: at most 3 stat-syscalls (kitty-specs dir stat + iterdir to compute dirent hash).
- Cache miss: full scan via `scan_all_features` from the legacy scanner.
- `get_mission()` reuses the same cache as `list_missions()`; no separate per-mission lookup.

**Threading**: per-cache `threading.Lock` guards mutations. Concurrent reads share the cache; concurrent mutations serialize.

**Resolution semantics for `get_mission(mission_id_or_slug)`**: try mission_id full match, then mid8 prefix match, then slug match. Return None on miss; ambiguous mid8 returns None (per data-model.md error contract).

### T009 — `WorkPackageRegistry` implementation

**File**: same.

**Action**: implement `WorkPackageRegistry` per the contract:

- Per-mission scope.
- Cache key derived from `(mtime_ns of tasks/, mtime_ns of status.events.jsonl, dirent hash of tasks/)`.
- `MissionRegistry.workpackages_for()` returns shared instances via `WeakValueDictionary` keyed by `mission_id`.
- Methods: `list_work_packages()`, `get_work_package()`, `lane_counts()`.

`lane_counts()` is the same data that appears on `MissionRecord.lane_counts` but accessed via the WP-scoped cache (per registry-interface.md). Use the existing `compute_weighted_progress` and `materialize` helpers from `specify_cli.status.*` for lane derivation; do not reinvent the lane reduction.

### T010 — Edge-case unit tests

**File**: `tests/test_dashboard/test_mission_registry.py` (new).

**Action**: author comprehensive tests covering the four explicit edge cases plus the cache-syscall budget assertion. Use real fixture projects + `os.utime`. NO mocks of `scan_all_features` (mission-wide rule C-003).

Test cases (each named explicitly per the spec edge-cases list):

```python
"""Mission registry unit tests — mtime cache + edge cases.

Per mission-wide rule C-003 (spec): tests use real fixture projects with
os.utime-bumped mtimes. NO mocks of scan_all_features or the filesystem.

## Branch Strategy

Lane-less on `feature/650-dashboard-ui-ux-overhaul`. Single mission, single branch.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] `src/dashboard/services/registry.py` exists with `MissionRegistry`, `WorkPackageRegistry`, `MissionRecord`, `WorkPackageRecord`, `LaneCounts`, `CacheEntry`.
- [ ] `src/dashboard/services/__init__.py` exports `MissionRegistry` and `WorkPackageRegistry` (and the record types if they're public).
- [ ] `tests/test_dashboard/test_mission_registry.py` covers all 4 explicit edge cases plus the syscall-budget assertion.
- [ ] All tests pass.
- [ ] No new `# type: ignore` directives in `registry.py` (NFR-006).
- [ ] No mocks of `scan_all_features` in the test file (mission-wide rule C-003).
- [ ] Frontmatter `dependencies: [WP01]` is honoured: WP01 must be merged before WP03 is implemented.

## Reviewer guidance

- **Test sanity**: open every test; ask "if I delete the registry implementation, would this test still pass?" If yes for any test, reject. The tests must constrain the registry's actual code paths.
- **Cache key correctness**: read the `_compute_list_cache_key` implementation. Confirm it uses the (mtime, size, dirent-hash) triple. The truncation-with-same-mtime test should fail without the size component.
- **Threading correctness**: confirm a `threading.Lock` guards cache mutations. The concurrent-readers test would expose a missing lock.
- **No reinvention of scanner logic**: confirm the registry calls `scan_all_features` and transforms the result; it does NOT reimplement the directory walk.

## Risks

- **Scanner divergence found by parity test**: WP01's parity baseline test may have surfaced a pre-existing scanner bug. The registry must NOT mask the divergence — if `scan_all_features` and `build_mission_registry` already disagree on the same fixture, the registry's `list_missions()` should match `scan_all_features` and document the divergence in `# TODO(scanner-fix)` markers, not silently consolidate.
- **Edge-case test for identical-mtime drift may be hard to hit reliably** on filesystems with sub-second mtime resolution. Document this in the test's docstring; mark `@pytest.mark.skipif` for filesystems known to have nanosecond resolution that prevents the artificial collision.
- **WeakValueDictionary subtlety**: `WorkPackageRegistry` instances may be GC'd between calls if no consumer holds a reference. This is intentional — fresh instances are cheap; cache state lives in the underlying mtime-keyed entries.
