## ⚡ Do This First: Load Agent Profile

```
/ad-hoc-profile-load implementer-ivan
```

You are Implementer Ivan. Your responsibility is comprehensive test coverage. Per mission-wide rule C-003, every architectural test ships with a positive AND a negative meta-test. Failure messages are actionable (name the violating file, name the rule violated, link the doctrine artefact).

## Objective

Land the three architectural tests that enforce this mission's three new doctrine artefacts (delivered by WP02). Land the `ResourceModel` + `Link` Pydantic marker classes so mission B can subclass.

The third test (`test_resource_models_have_links.py`) lights up vacuously in this mission per spec C-006 — no class subclasses `ResourceModel` here. The marker class is in place; the test is in place; mission B activates the enforcement when it introduces the first resource-oriented endpoint.

## Context

The contracts for each test are fully specified in `kitty-specs/mission-registry-and-api-boundary-doctrine-01KQPDBB/contracts/architectural-test-contracts.md`. Read all three contracts before writing any test code; the contract is the source of truth.

The directives this WP enforces (`DIRECTIVE_API_DEPENDENCY_DIRECTION`, `DIRECTIVE_REST_RESOURCE_ORIENTATION`, `HATEOAS-LITE`) are delivered by WP02. The router-side compliance (every router uses the registry, no scanner imports in transport) is delivered by WP04. This WP layers the enforcement on top.

## Subtasks

### T014 — `Link` and `ResourceModel` Pydantic marker classes

**File**: `src/dashboard/api/models.py`.

**Action**: append the marker classes per `data-model.md`:

```python
# --- HATEOAS-LITE marker classes (introduced by mission
# mission-registry-and-api-boundary-doctrine-01KQPDBB; mission B will
# subclass ResourceModel for the new resource-oriented endpoints) ---


class Link(BaseModel):
    """A single HATEOAS-LITE hyperlink. Subset of HAL's link object.

    See doctrine paradigm `hateoas-lite` (src/doctrine/paradigms/shipped/
    hateoas-lite.paradigm.yaml) for the full convention and future-graduation
    triggers (HAL / JSON:API).
    """

    href: str
    method: str = "GET"


class ResourceModel(BaseModel):
    """Marker base class for resource-oriented response models.

    Subclasses MUST declare a `_links: dict[str, Link]` field. Enforced by
    `tests/architectural/test_resource_models_have_links.py`.

    No subclass exists in this mission (per spec C-006). Mission B introduces
    the first subclass when it ships the new resource-oriented endpoints.
    """

    pass
```

Append `Link` and `ResourceModel` to the module's `__all__`.

**No backward incompatibility**: this is a strict addition; existing models do NOT subclass `ResourceModel` and are unaffected.

### T015 — `test_transport_does_not_import_scanner.py`

**File**: `tests/architectural/test_transport_does_not_import_scanner.py` (new).

**Action**: implement per `contracts/architectural-test-contracts.md` § 1. The full skeleton:

```python
"""Enforces DIRECTIVE_API_DEPENDENCY_DIRECTION.

Doctrine: src/doctrine/directives/shipped/api-dependency-direction.directive.yaml

No transport-side module (FastAPI router, dashboard CLI command body) may
import from specify_cli.dashboard.scanner or specify_cli.scanner directly.
The MissionRegistry in src/dashboard/services/registry.py is the single
sanctioned reader.

## Branch Strategy

Lane-less on `feature/650-dashboard-ui-ux-overhaul`. Four files; commit as a single `feat(WP05-...)` commit.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] `Link` and `ResourceModel` marker classes exist in `src/dashboard/api/models.py` with the documented contract.
- [ ] Three architectural tests exist at the documented paths.
- [ ] Each architectural test ships with the main scan + a positive meta-test + a negative meta-test (mission-wide rule C-003).
- [ ] All three tests pass on the current state of the codebase (after WP04's migration is in place).
- [ ] Failure messages name the violating file/line and link the doctrine artefact.
- [ ] No `# noqa` or test-skip markers added to production code to bypass these tests.

## Reviewer guidance

- **Meta-test discipline**: confirm BOTH meta-tests for each architectural test (positive AND negative). A test that only has a positive meta-test could regress to "always passes"; a test with both catches scanner-logic bugs.
- **Failure-message actionability**: the assertion error message MUST name what failed AND what to do about it. Ideal pattern: "X violates rule Y; fix: do Z; see doctrine path."
- **No source-code escape hatches**: confirm WP04 did not add `# noqa` markers or `if TYPE_CHECKING:` shenanigans to bypass the scan. If the scanner finds a violation, the fix is in the production code, not in the test.
- **Vacuous pass on T017 is OK**: per spec C-006, `test_resource_models_have_links.py` passes with zero subclasses today. Confirm the test is not vacuous on mission B's first subclass.

## Risks

- **WP04's migration left a sneaky scanner import**: T015's main scan would catch it; the WP04 reviewer should have caught it earlier. If T015 fails, send the violation back to WP04, do not patch it from this WP.
- **The action allowlist grows large**: every URL today that doesn't match the resource-noun convention goes in the allowlist with rationale. That's fine for mission A (no rename); mission B prunes the allowlist as it renames URLs.
- **Pydantic field-name policy on `_links`**: Pydantic v2 may warn or reject leading-underscore field names. If so, switch to `links` and update the paradigm YAML + the test accordingly. Document the change in the WP review.
