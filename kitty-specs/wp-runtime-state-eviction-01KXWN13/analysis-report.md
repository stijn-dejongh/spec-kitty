## Specification Analysis Report

Cross-artifact consistency check of `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md` for mission
`wp-runtime-state-eviction-01KXWN13`. This mission was hardened by five adversarial squads
(post-spec, post-plan, post-tasks) whose convergent findings were already folded into the artifacts;
this pass confirms coverage and surfaces the residual seams.

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| C1 | Coverage | MEDIUM | WP05 (T019) / `cli/commands/agent/tasks.py` | SC-004 render re-point is split: `task_utils/support.py` is WP05-owned, but the second renderer `cli/commands/agent/tasks.py` is not in any WP's `owned_files` (WP05 flags it as a documented out-of-map edit). Risk: the Activity Log renders blank post-eviction if that path is missed. | Confirm the `tasks.py` render path in review, or add it to WP05's `owned_files`; assert render parity in WP10/T038a's golden. |
| S1 | Scope | LOW | plan.md §IC-08 / tasks.md (deferred note) | IC-08 (`wp_metadata` inert fields, `WP_FIELD_ORDER` cosmetic slots) is explicitly deferred to a post-cutover follow-up. Not a gap — recorded for traceability so it is not lost. | Track as a follow-up reduction after this mission merges. |

**Coverage Summary Table (Functional Requirements):**

| Requirement | Has Task? | Task/WP | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR-001 event class | ✅ | WP01 | InnerStateChanged + typed delta |
| FR-002 reducer fold | ✅ | WP01 | branch/preserve/partition |
| FR-003 subtask event-sourced | ✅ | WP02 (gate), WP04 (emit/reader) | red test green |
| FR-004 claim policy_metadata | ✅ | WP01 (fold), WP07 (writer) | resume emit WP07/T029a |
| FR-005 reader cutover | ✅ | WP05, WP10 (verify) | dual-write default |
| FR-006 tracker_refs evict | ✅ | WP06, WP07 (strike), WP08 | union + replace |
| FR-007 activity-log notes | ✅ | WP04, WP06, WP08 | + SC-004 render WP05 |
| FR-008 no WP-file writes | ✅ | WP06, WP07 | god-write + tails |
| FR-009 review both-halves | ✅ | WP09, WP10 (fallback delete) | + post_merge reader |
| FR-010 MUTABLE_FIELDS / history | ✅ | WP03, WP07, WP10 | history→MUTABLE_FIELDS |
| FR-011 migration | ✅ | WP03 | fail-closed verify |
| FR-012 destination_ref (#2647) | ✅ | WP06, WP08 | SC-008 |
| FR-013 arch invariant | ✅ | WP10 | no dynamic-frontmatter authority |
| FR-014 implement.py restructuring | ✅ | WP07 | mission owns it |
| FR-015 force provenance | ✅ | WP02 (3 edges), WP06 (2 in_review) | persisted-force |

**Success-criteria coverage:** SC-001/SC-005 → WP10/T038 (sole); SC-002 → WP05; SC-003 → WP04;
SC-004 → WP05 (renderer) + WP10/T038a (golden) — see C1; SC-006 → WP03; SC-007 → WP02 + WP06;
SC-008 → WP08/T032. All eight have an owner.

**Charter Alignment Issues:** none. The charter's "Single canonical authority — every rule, surface,
and identity has ONE owning source" is the invariant this mission *delivers*; FR-013's refactor-stable
architectural test is the enforcing artifact. No requirement or plan element conflicts with a MUST
principle.

**Unmapped Tasks:** none — every subtask rolls up under a WP whose `requirement_refs` are validated;
`map-requirements` reports zero unmapped functionals.

**Metrics:**

- Total functional requirements: 15 · non-functional: 5 · constraints: 6
- Total subtasks: 42 across 10 WPs (WP prompt sizes 242–378 lines, all in range)
- FR coverage: **100%** (15/15 with ≥1 task)
- Ambiguity count: 0 (the underspecified items — `tracker_refs --replace`, `ReviewOverride` names, the
  dual-write flag owner — were pinned in the post-tasks revision)
- Duplication count: 0 (SC-001/005 double-ownership was deduped to WP10/T038)
- Critical issues: 0

## Next Actions

No CRITICAL or HIGH findings → **ready to implement**. The single MEDIUM (C1) is a review-time
verification, not a blocker: confirm the `cli/commands/agent/tasks.py` Activity-Log render path is
covered (WP05's out-of-map edit + WP10/T038a's render-parity golden are the safety net). The LOW (S1)
is an intentional deferral.

Suggested: proceed to `/spec-kitty.implement` (or the implement-review loop). No re-run of
`/spec-kitty.specify`, `/plan`, or `/tasks` is required.
