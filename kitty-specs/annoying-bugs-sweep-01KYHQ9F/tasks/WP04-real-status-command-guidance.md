# Work Package Prompt: WP04 - Real status command guidance

## ⚡ Do This First: Load Agent Profile

Use `/ad-hoc-profile-load`, resolve `curator-carla` with
`spec-kitty agent profile show curator-carla`, and load
`spec-kitty charter context --action implement --json`.

- **Profile**: `curator-carla`
- **Role**: `curator`
- **Agent/tool**: `codex`

## Objective

Remove concrete examples of the nonexistent top-level `spec-kitty status` command from the
canonical styleguide and four scoped published documentation pages, replacing each with the real
command that matches its local intent.

## Constraints

- Do not add a top-level `status` command.
- Do not edit `docs/changelog/CHANGELOG.md` or archived `kitty-specs/**`.
- Do not blindly replace every string with `spec-kitty agent tasks status`; upgrade checks,
  environment behavior, and WP status are different domains.
- Preserve generic prose that means “a status command” rather than a literal invocation.

## Branch Strategy

- **Planning base**: `fix/annoying-bugs-sweep`
- **Merge target**: `fix/annoying-bugs-sweep`
- Execute in the workspace allocated by finalization.

## Subtasks

### T030 - Open the WP: tracker, ownership, and campsite

Before edits, assign #2983 to the current Human-in-Charge and add a tracker comment naming this
mission. Re-check the intended diff against C-005 and all other WP ownership, then perform a bounded
domain-matched campsite scout of the owned doctrine, documentation, and test surfaces. Apply any
necessary behavior-preserving cleanup first with focused checks, or record a clean finding. Stop and
revise ownership before touching an undeclared file.

### T018 - Classify occurrences

For each scoped occurrence, identify the intended owning command from the live Typer tree and
`--help`. Record the classification in the test parametrization or a concise code comment where it
prevents future blind substitution.

### T019 - Correct the styleguide

Change the `good_example` to the real WP status command while preserving the plain-language lesson.
Keep the canonical source YAML valid and avoid generated copies.

### T020 - Correct published docs

Update only:

- `docs/api/environment-variables.md`
- `docs/api/upgrade-lifecycle.md`
- `docs/architecture/launch-readiness-future.md`
- `docs/guides/install-and-upgrade.md`

Use current command help as the authority. Preserve surrounding semantics, option spelling, and
environment examples.

### T021 - Regression guard

Add a non-vacuous architectural test over the exact scoped source set. Resolve each concrete command
through the real Typer command tree; do not certify a hand-maintained allowlist. Assert the file
denominator and include a self-mutation fixture proving a nonexistent replacement turns the gate
red, so deletion or inventory drift cannot green the test.

### T022 - Gates

```bash
PWHEADLESS=1 pytest tests/architectural/test_status_command_guidance.py -q
PWHEADLESS=1 pytest tests/architectural/test_docs_cli_reference_parity.py -q
PWHEADLESS=1 pytest tests/architectural/test_no_legacy_terminology.py -q
ruff check tests/architectural/test_status_command_guidance.py
npx --yes markdownlint-cli2@0.18.1 --config .markdownlint-cli2.jsonc docs/api/environment-variables.md docs/api/upgrade-lifecycle.md docs/architecture/launch-readiness-future.md docs/guides/install-and-upgrade.md
```

Validate YAML and Markdown formatting with the repository's existing focused checks.

## Definition Of Done

- Every scoped concrete example names a real, intent-correct command.
- The canonical styleguide remains valid.
- Changelog and archived mission history are untouched.
- A non-vacuous test prevents recurrence.
- The actual changed-file set remains disjoint from every other WP.

## Reviewer Guidance

Review each replacement in context. Reject uniform substitution, historical rewrites, or a test
that merely asserts the forbidden string disappeared without validating the replacement.
