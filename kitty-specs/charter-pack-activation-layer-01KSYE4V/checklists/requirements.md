- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified (cascade shared-artifact protection, no-charter fallback, atomic backup)

## Notes

All items pass. Spec is ready for `/spec-kitty.plan`.
