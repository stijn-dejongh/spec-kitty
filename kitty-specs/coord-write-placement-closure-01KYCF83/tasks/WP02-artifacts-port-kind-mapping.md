## Objective

This is the **foundational placement WP** (no dependencies). It owns `src/mission_runtime/artifacts.py` — the single partition SSOT — and merges **two** collision edits into one pass so no other WP co-edits this file:

1. **IC-03 (FR-002)**: give `PRIMARY_METADATA` a partition-aware write target — the **one-field flip** `commit_target=None` → `commit_target=placement_ref` at `artifacts.py:218-224` (delete the special-case arm so it matches the generic primary arm), so `write_meta` / `_flip_phase` / `_bake_mission_number` can route meta writes through the port and a coord/primary two-partition write becomes expressible.
2. **IC-04-classify (FR-003, FR-006)**: classify `decisions.events.jsonl` and `traces/` in the SSOT dicts `_MISSION_FILE_KIND_BY_BASENAME:181` and `_COORD_RESIDUE_DIRS:207` (both currently classify to `None` → COORD). Classification lives **only** in these two dicts — writers CALL `kind_for_mission_file`, they never classify inline.

**Done** = the sentinel flip lands with a grep-verified inert-consumer audit; `decisions.events.jsonl` + `traces/` resolve to COORD via the single classifier; `assert_partition_invariant()` stays exhaustive + disjoint; a new unit test pins the mapping.

## Context & Constraints

- Spec: [spec.md](../spec.md) US3 AS2/AS4, FR-002, FR-003, FR-006. Plan: [plan.md](../plan.md) IC-03 + IC-04-classify. Data model: [data-model.md](../data-model.md) "MissionArtifactKind → MissionArtifactHome". Research D-01, D-05.
- **C-002 boundary**: this is an *extension* of the existing port kind-mapping, NOT a `MissionArtifactHome`/topology re-architecture. Do not touch topology resolution.
- **Layering (folded squad finding)**: `mission_runtime` already imports `specify_cli` (top-level + ~40 late). **Add NO new top-level `specify_cli` import** to `artifacts.py`.
- **Cross-WP coordination (resolution.py:949)**: the sole `commit_target` consumer lives at `resolution.py:949`, which is owned by **WP07** (the read-authority WP). Your job here is the *audit* (T005): grep-confirm no consumer reads `commit_target is None` as "skip commit". If the flip requires a consumer change, that change is made in WP07 (which lands after this WP transitively via the gate) — record the finding in `tracers/design-decisions.md` and hand it to WP07. Do NOT edit `resolution.py`.

## Branch Strategy

- **Strategy**: generated on `feat/coord-write-placement-closure`; changes merge back into `feat/coord-write-placement-closure`.
- **Planning base branch**: `feat/coord-write-placement-closure`
- **Merge target branch**: `feat/coord-write-placement-closure`

## Subtasks & Detailed Guidance

### Subtask T005 – Audit the `commit_target is None` sentinel consumers (RED-safety first)

- **Purpose**: FR-002 risk (a) — before flipping the sentinel, prove no consumer treats `None` as "skip commit".
- **Steps**: `grep -rn "commit_target" src/` and inspect every read site, especially `resolution.py:949`. Confirm the sentinel is inert today (the plan's grep says so — verify on this branch). Record the audit result in `tracers/design-decisions.md` (mission dir, not owned_files). If a consumer DOES branch on `None`, stop and hand the required consumer edit to WP07 with the exact site.
- **Files**: read-only + tracer note.
- **Validation**: written audit with the enumerated consumer sites.

### Subtask T006 – Flip `PRIMARY_METADATA.commit_target` to partition-aware

- **Purpose**: FR-002 — route meta writes through the port.
- **Steps**: At `artifacts.py:218-224`, delete the `PRIMARY_METADATA` special-case arm (`commit_target=None`) so it resolves through the same generic PRIMARY arm as other primary kinds, yielding `commit_target=placement_ref`. Keep the change surgical — one arm removed, not a mapping rewrite.
- **Files**: `src/mission_runtime/artifacts.py`.
- **Validation**: `PRIMARY_METADATA` now resolves a non-None `commit_target`; existing `resolve_placement_only(PRIMARY_METADATA)` callers get a routed target.
- **Edge cases**: ensure the generic arm actually covers `PRIMARY_METADATA`'s partition (PRIMARY) — do not accidentally route meta to COORD.

### Subtask T007 – Classify `decisions.events.jsonl` in the basename SSOT

- **Purpose**: FR-003 — `decisions.events.jsonl` must resolve to COORD via the classifier.
- **Steps**: Add `decisions.events.jsonl` to `_MISSION_FILE_KIND_BY_BASENAME:181` mapping to its COORD-homed kind. Do NOT classify at any writer site — writers (WP03) call `kind_for_mission_file`.
- **Files**: `src/mission_runtime/artifacts.py`.
- **Validation**: `kind_for_mission_file("decisions.events.jsonl")` returns the COORD-homed kind.

### Subtask T008 – Classify `traces/` in the residue-dirs SSOT

- **Purpose**: FR-006 — `traces/` classified to COORD.
- **Steps**: Add `traces/` to `_COORD_RESIDUE_DIRS:207` (or the correct residue-dir SSOT) so `traces/` resolves COORD. Note in the tracer that this is a PRIMARY→COORD reclassification that may move existing writes (WP03 routes the writers).
- **Files**: `src/mission_runtime/artifacts.py`.
- **Validation**: a `traces/…` path classifies to COORD via the classifier.
- **Edge cases**: confirm no other classifier already homes `traces/` to PRIMARY (avoid a double-home that breaks disjointness).

### Subtask T009 – Pin the mapping + partition invariant (unit test)

- **Purpose**: lock the SSOT so a future edit that breaks exhaustiveness/disjointness reds.
- **Steps**: Write `tests/mission_runtime/test_artifact_partition_mapping.py` asserting: (a) `PRIMARY_METADATA` resolves a non-None PRIMARY `commit_target`; (b) `decisions.events.jsonl` → COORD; (c) `traces/` → COORD; (d) `assert_partition_invariant()` passes (exhaustive + disjoint). Use behavioral assertions on the resolver, not literal dict snapshots that break on unrelated additions.
- **Files**: `tests/mission_runtime/test_artifact_partition_mapping.py` (new).
- **Validation**: test green; deleting either classification makes it red.

## Test Strategy

- New: `tests/mission_runtime/test_artifact_partition_mapping.py`.
- Run: `PWHEADLESS=1 uv run --extra test pytest tests/mission_runtime/test_artifact_partition_mapping.py -q` plus the existing `mission_runtime` partition tests to confirm no regression.

## Definition of Done

- `PRIMARY_METADATA.commit_target` flipped; sentinel audit recorded.
- `decisions.events.jsonl` + `traces/` classified COORD in the two SSOT dicts only.
- `assert_partition_invariant()` exhaustive + disjoint.
- No new top-level `specify_cli` import in `artifacts.py`.
- `ruff` + `mypy` clean.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Sentinel not inert** → T005 audit gates the flip; hand consumer edit to WP07.
- **traces/ double-home** → T008 disjointness check + T009 invariant assertion.
- **Scope creep into topology** → keep to the two dicts + one arm (C-002).

## Review Guidance

- Verify classification lands ONLY in the two SSOT dicts, never at writer sites.
- Verify the sentinel audit is recorded and the consumer at `resolution.py:949` was handed to WP07 if non-inert.
- Verify no new top-level `specify_cli` import.
