branch_strategy: Planning artifacts for this mission were generated on feat/single-mission-surface-resolver. During /spec-kitty.implement this WP may branch from a dependency-specific base, but completed changes must merge back into feat/single-mission-surface-resolver unless the human explicitly redirects the landing branch.

## ⚡ Do This First: Load Agent Profile
Load `python-pedro`; acknowledge its initialization declaration.

## Objective
The core collapse: make `coordination/surface_resolver.resolve_status_surface_with_anchor` the **sole** surface-selection authority (FR-001/FR-007), migrate the `status_transition.py` coord predicates to it + drain the C-002 allowlist (#1900), and implement the **coord-empty hard-fail** with an actionable two-path message (FR-006) + an ADR (#1716). (IC-06 + IC-08)

**HARD GATE (C-004): do NOT delete/repoint any resolver until the WP02 equivalence matrix is GREEN for the affected input classes.**

## Context
- `coordination/surface_resolver.py` is the chosen canonical owner (research D1, richest topology logic).
- `coordination/status_transition.py` `_is_coordination_feature_dir`/`_is_coord_worktree_feature_dir` are a 5th parallel selection site (#1900); `tests/architectural/test_topology_resolution_boundary.py:95` allowlists it.
- FR-006 (research D3): a **materialized-but-empty** coord worktree → hard-fail `STATUS_READ_PATH_NOT_FOUND`; message names BOTH recovery paths (collapse/flatten OR recreate/populate). Distinct from no-coord (primary authoritative).

## Subtasks
### T021 — Sole authority (FR-001/FR-007)
- Confirm/route every selection through `resolve_status_surface_with_anchor`; it consumes the WP03 delegator/primitives. No parallel selection logic remains in this surface.
### T022 — Migrate `status_transition.py` predicates (#1900)
- Replace `_is_coordination_feature_dir`/`_is_coord_worktree_feature_dir` with calls to the canonical resolver / `classify_worktree_topology`. No local topology predicate.
### T023 — Drain the C-002 allowlist (#1900, SC-005 proof)
- Remove `status_transition.py` from `tests/architectural/test_topology_resolution_boundary.py`'s allowlist (line ~95); the ratchet now enforces zero parallel selectors there.
### T024 — Coord-empty hard-fail (FR-006)
- Materialized-but-empty coord → raise `STATUS_READ_PATH_NOT_FOUND` whose message names collapse/flatten OR recreate/populate. NO silent primary fallback. Keep no-coord → primary (create→first-write window). Mutation-verified test.
### T025 — ADR (#1716)
- Write `architecture/3.x/adr/2026-06-19-1-coord-empty-surface-fallback.md` recording the hard-fail decision + rationale, bound to the single resolver.
### T026 — Gates (mechanical gate teeth)
- `ruff` + `mypy --strict` clean; the **full WP02 equivalence matrix is GREEN** with mechanical proof: `rg "xfail" tests/missions/test_surface_resolution_equivalence.py` → **0** (every divergence cell closed, none lingering as xfail — this is the CI enforcement of the C-004 gate, not a reviewer eyeball). `tests/status tests/coordination tests/architectural` + a broad run pass (NFR-002 no regression).

## Branch Strategy
Planning/base + merge target: `feat/single-mission-surface-resolver`. Worktree per lane. **Depends WP02 (equivalence green — hard gate), WP03, WP04, WP05.**

## Definition of Done
- [ ] `resolve_status_surface_with_anchor` is the sole selection authority; status_transition.py predicates migrated; no parallel selector remains.
- [ ] C-002 topology-ratchet allowlist entry for status_transition.py drained (SC-005).
- [ ] Coord-empty hard-fails with the two-path message; no-coord still resolves primary; mutation-verified.
- [ ] ADR committed (#1716 policy).
- [ ] WP02 equivalence matrix fully green, **mechanically proven** (`rg "xfail" tests/missions/test_surface_resolution_equivalence.py` → 0); ruff + mypy --strict clean; no regression.

## Risks / Reviewer guidance
- **Risk**: deleting a duplicate before its equivalence cells are green (C-004 violation). The reviewer MUST confirm the WP02 matrix is fully green (no remaining xfails) before approving.
- **Reviewer**: independently verify the coord-empty message names BOTH recovery paths; confirm the allowlist entry is gone and the ratchet test still passes; confirm no-coord still maps to primary.
