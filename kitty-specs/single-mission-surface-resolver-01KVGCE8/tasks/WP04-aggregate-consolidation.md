## ⚡ Do This First: Load Agent Profile
Load `python-pedro`; acknowledge its initialization declaration.

## Objective
Consolidate all `status/aggregate.py` surface-resolution work: kill the silent-first-match `glob` mid8 path (FR-008/T2) and make `_resolve_read_dir` a thin adapter over the canonical resolver/delegator (T3, part of FR-007). One module, one WP (file-ownership). (IC-03 + IC-06)

## Context
- `aggregate.py:~473` `_find_meta_path`: `for c in sorted(specs_dir.glob(f"{mission_slug}-*/meta.json"))` — silent first-match, the opposite of the `MISSION_AMBIGUOUS_SELECTOR` contract (S8 ambiguity).
- `aggregate.py:~336` `_resolve_read_dir`: re-gates `is_under_worktrees_segment(...) and not .exists() → primary_candidate`, overriding the canonical resolver for the unmaterialized-coord case (a divergence source).

## Subtasks
### T014 — Kill the silent glob (FR-008/T2)
- Route mid8 disambiguation through the one canonical handle resolver (`_canonicalize_handle`/`resolve_mission`); ambiguous → `MISSION_AMBIGUOUS_SELECTOR`, never silent-pick.
### T015 — Thin-adapter `_resolve_read_dir` (T3)
- Re-point to the WP03 shared delegator; remove the duplicate unmaterialized-coord re-gate so aggregate no longer overrides the canonical resolver. (This deletes a duplicate → gated on WP02 equivalence-green for aggregate's input classes, C-004.)
### T016 — Negative tests (+ the create→first-write contract)
- Ambiguous-mid8 → `MISSION_AMBIGUOUS_SELECTOR` (mutation: restore the glob → test fails). Coord-fresh/coord-empty resolution matches the canonical resolver. **CRITICAL distinct cell**: the **no-coord create→first-write** window (primary has the spec, no `coordination_branch`; `aggregate.py:327` preserves this on `FileNotFoundError`) MUST still resolve **PRIMARY** (not a hard-fail) after the re-gate is removed — mutation-verified. Do not conflate it with the coord-empty hard-fail (FR-006/WP06): coord-empty = materialized-but-empty coord → hard-fail; no-coord create-window = primary. Both must be asserted separately.
### T017 — Gates
- `ruff` + `mypy --strict` clean; run `tests/status/`; the WP02 equivalence matrix's aggregate cells turn green.

## Branch Strategy
Planning/base + merge target: `feat/single-mission-surface-resolver`. Worktree per lane. Depends **WP02** (gate) + **WP03** (delegator/primitives).

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Silent glob removed; mid8 routed through the canonical handle resolver (ambiguous → typed error), mutation-verified.
- [ ] `_resolve_read_dir` is a thin adapter over the WP03 delegator; the duplicate re-gate is gone.
- [ ] no-coord create→first-write window still resolves PRIMARY (not hard-fail), asserted as a distinct cell from coord-empty, mutation-verified.
- [ ] aggregate's equivalence cells green (WP02); no regression in `tests/status/`.
- [ ] ruff + mypy --strict clean.

## Risks / Reviewer guidance
- **Risk**: removing the re-gate changes coord-fresh/coord-empty behavior — must match the canonical resolver (proven by the WP02 matrix). Do not delete it before those cells are green.
- **Reviewer**: confirm the ambiguous-mid8 negative test is mutation-killing; confirm no second mid8 path remains in aggregate.
