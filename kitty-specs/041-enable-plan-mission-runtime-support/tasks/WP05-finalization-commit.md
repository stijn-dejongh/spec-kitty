# WP05: Finalization & Commit

**Objective**: Execute the finalize-tasks command to parse dependencies, update work package frontmatter, validate the dependency graph, and commit all completed work to the 2.x branch.

**Context**: After WP04 is complete, all work packages are ready to be finalized. The finalize-tasks command handles the final verification and commit, ensuring dependencies are properly documented in frontmatter and committed to the target branch.

**Key Success Criterion**: All work packages are committed to the 2.x branch with validated dependencies in frontmatter.

**Included Commands**:
- `spec-kitty agent feature finalize-tasks --json` (main command)

## Subtask Breakdown

### Subtask T018: Run Finalize-Tasks Command

**Duration**: 15-30 minutes
**Goal**: Execute finalization and verify all work packages are properly committed.

**Prerequisites**:
- [ ] WP01 completed and implementation verified
- [ ] WP02 completed and implementation verified
- [ ] WP03 completed and implementation verified
- [ ] WP04 completed and all tests passing
- [ ] All work package files exist in tasks/ directory
- [ ] All changes are staged/committed locally (if using git)

**Steps**:

1. **Verify preconditions**:
   ```bash
   # Check git status - should be clean or staged
   git status

   # Verify all WP files exist
   ls -la kitty-specs/041-enable-plan-mission-runtime-support/tasks/
   # Expected files:
   # - WP01-runtime-schema-foundation.md
   # - WP02-command-templates.md
   # - WP03-content-test-setup.md
   # - WP04-integration-regression-tests.md
   # - WP05-finalization-commit.md
   ```

2. **Run finalize-tasks command**:
   ```bash
   spec-kitty agent feature finalize-tasks --json
   ```

   **Expected Output** (JSON):
   ```json
   {
     "result": "success",
     "feature_slug": "041-enable-plan-mission-runtime-support",
     "target_branch": "2.x",
     "wps_updated": 5,
     "dependencies_parsed": {
       "WP01": [],
       "WP02": ["WP01"],
       "WP03": ["WP02"],
       "WP04": ["WP03"],
       "WP05": ["WP04"]
     },
     "commit_created": true,
     "commit_hash": "abc123def456...",
     "commit_message": "tasks: Generate work packages for feature 041",
     "validation": {
       "cycles_detected": false,
       "orphaned_wps": false,
       "missing_wps": false
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Verify JSON output**:
   - [ ] result == "success" (not error)
   - [ ] feature_slug == "041-enable-plan-mission-runtime-support"
   - [ ] target_branch == "2.x"
   - [ ] wps_updated == 5 (all 5 WPs)
   - [ ] dependencies_parsed shows correct chain (WP01→WP02→WP03→WP04→WP05)
   - [ ] commit_created == true
   - [ ] commit_hash is present (40-char hex string)
   - [ ] validation.cycles_detected == false
   - [ ] validation.orphaned_wps == false
   - [ ] validation.missing_wps == false

4. **Verify dependencies in work package frontmatter**:
   ```bash
   # Check WP01 frontmatter (should have no dependencies)
   head -20 kitty-specs/041-enable-plan-mission-runtime-support/tasks/WP01-runtime-schema-foundation.md
   # Should show: dependencies: []

   # Check WP02 frontmatter (should depend on WP01)
   head -20 kitty-specs/041-enable-plan-mission-runtime-support/tasks/WP02-command-templates.md
   # Should show: dependencies: ["WP01"]

   # Check WP03 frontmatter (should depend on WP02)
   head -20 kitty-specs/041-enable-plan-mission-runtime-support/tasks/WP03-content-test-setup.md
   # Should show: dependencies: ["WP02"]

   # Check WP04 frontmatter (should depend on WP03)
   head -20 kitty-specs/041-enable-plan-mission-runtime-support/tasks/WP04-integration-regression-tests.md
   # Should show: dependencies: ["WP03"]

   # Check WP05 frontmatter (should depend on WP04)
   head -20 kitty-specs/041-enable-plan-mission-runtime-support/tasks/WP05-finalization-commit.md
   # Should show: dependencies: ["WP04"]
   ```

5. **Verify git commit**:
   ```bash
   # Check latest commit
   git log -1 --oneline

   # Should show commit from finalize-tasks command
   # Example: "tasks: Generate work packages for feature 041"

   # Verify commit hash matches JSON output
   git log -1 --format=%H
   # Should match: commit_hash from JSON
   ```

6. **Verify files are committed**:
   ```bash
   # Check git status - should show no uncommitted changes
   git status

   # List committed files
   git show --name-only

   # Should include:
   # kitty-specs/041-enable-plan-mission-runtime-support/tasks.md
   # kitty-specs/041-enable-plan-mission-runtime-support/tasks/WP01-runtime-schema-foundation.md
   # kitty-specs/041-enable-plan-mission-runtime-support/tasks/WP02-command-templates.md
   # kitty-specs/041-enable-plan-mission-runtime-support/tasks/WP03-content-test-setup.md
   # kitty-specs/041-enable-plan-mission-runtime-support/tasks/WP04-integration-regression-tests.md
   # kitty-specs/041-enable-plan-mission-runtime-support/tasks/WP05-finalization-commit.md
   ```

7. **Validate dependency graph** (if detected issues):
   ```bash
   # If cycles detected:
   spec-kitty agent feature finalize-tasks --json
   # Check validation.cycles_detected - must be false

   # If orphaned WPs detected:
   # Check which WPs are orphaned (not reachable from any root)
   # Fix by updating dependencies in work packages

   # If missing WPs detected:
   # Verify all WP files are present in tasks/ directory
   ```

8. **Verify branch is correct**:
   ```bash
   git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
   # Should show: 2.x

   git branch --show-current
   # Should also show: 2.x
   ```

**Critical Notes**:
- ⚠️ **DO NOT run `git commit` or `git push` after finalize-tasks**
- ⚠️ finalize-tasks automatically commits all changes
- ⚠️ Only run finalize-tasks once (it's idempotent but should only be needed once)
- ⚠️ If there are unrelated files showing in `git status`, those are UNRELATED to finalize-tasks (e.g., config, templates)

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] finalize-tasks succeeds (result == "success")
- [ ] 5 WPs are updated with dependencies
- [ ] Commit is created and committed to 2.x
- [ ] All dependencies are correctly parsed
- [ ] No cycles detected
- [ ] No orphaned WPs
- [ ] All WP frontmatter contains dependencies field
- [ ] git log shows finalize-tasks commit
- [ ] Feature is ready for implementation

---

## Validation Checklist

Complete these checks to verify finalization was successful:

```
Pre-Finalization:
- [ ] WP01 implementation complete
- [ ] WP02 implementation complete
- [ ] WP03 implementation complete
- [ ] WP04 implementation complete (all tests passing)
- [ ] All WP files exist in tasks/
- [ ] tasks.md is complete and committed

Finalization:
- [ ] finalize-tasks command executed successfully
- [ ] JSON output shows "result": "success"
- [ ] 5 WPs processed and updated
- [ ] Dependencies correctly parsed and updated
- [ ] No validation errors (cycles, orphans, missing)

Post-Finalization:
- [ ] All WP frontmatter has dependencies field
- [ ] git log shows finalize-tasks commit
- [ ] git show confirms all WP files committed
- [ ] Current branch is 2.x
- [ ] git status is clean

Implementation Ready:
- [ ] All artifacts in place (schema, templates, tests)
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Dependencies documented
- [ ] Committed to 2.x branch
- [ ] Ready for `spec-kitty implement WP01`
```

---

## Definition of Done

- [x] finalize-tasks command executed
- [x] All 5 WPs updated with dependencies
- [x] Dependency chain valid: WP01 → WP02 → WP03 → WP04 → WP05
- [x] No cycles in dependency graph
- [x] No orphaned WPs
- [x] Commit created on 2.x branch
- [x] All WP frontmatter has dependencies field
- [x] All artifacts committed to target branch
- [x] Ready for implementation phase

---

## What Happens Next

After this work package completes:

1. **Feature is Ready**: All work packages are defined, committed, and dependencies documented
2. **Implementation Begins**: Users can run:
   ```bash
   spec-kitty implement WP01
   spec-kitty implement WP02 --base WP01
   spec-kitty implement WP03 --base WP02
   spec-kitty implement WP04 --base WP03
   spec-kitty implement WP05 --base WP04
   ```

3. **Each WP is Implemented**: Agents work on individual WPs, isolated in worktrees
4. **Code Review**: Each completed WP is reviewed before merging
5. **Feature Complete**: All WPs merged to 2.x, feature is live

---

## Troubleshooting

**If finalize-tasks fails**:

1. **"Multiple features found" error**:
   - Feature auto-detection ambiguous
   - Solution: Ensure only one incomplete feature (041-enable-plan-mission-runtime-support)

2. **"Missing work package files" error**:
   - Not all WP files exist in tasks/
   - Solution: Verify all 5 WP files are present in tasks/ directory

3. **Cycles detected error**:
   - Dependency graph has circular reference
   - Solution: Review dependencies in WP frontmatter, fix any cycles

4. **Commit fails error**:
   - Git commit operation failed
   - Solution: Check git status, resolve any conflicts

**If something goes wrong**:

1. Review JSON output for specific error message
2. Fix the issue (missing files, invalid dependencies, git errors)
3. Run finalize-tasks again (it's safe to re-run)
4. Verify all checks pass

---

## Reviewer Guidance

**What to Check**:
1. Did finalize-tasks succeed?
2. Are all 5 WPs present and updated?
3. Is the dependency chain correct (WP01 → WP02 → WP03 → WP04 → WP05)?
4. Are there any cycles or orphaned WPs?
5. Is the commit on the 2.x branch?

**Green Light**: finalize-tasks succeeds, all WPs updated, dependencies correct, committed to 2.x.

**Red Light**: finalize-tasks fails, WPs missing, invalid dependencies, or commit issues.

---

## Summary

Feature 041 (Enable Plan Mission Runtime Support) is complete when:

✅ WP01: Runtime Schema Foundation - mission-runtime.yaml created
✅ WP02: Command Templates - all 4 step templates created
✅ WP03: Content & Test Setup - test framework ready
✅ WP04: Integration & Regression Tests - comprehensive test suite
✅ WP05: Finalization & Commit - dependencies parsed and committed

All work packages are now ready for agents to implement, review, and merge back to the 2.x branch.

**Total Effort**: ~10-12 hours of implementation work across 5 work packages
**Parallelization**: WPs can be implemented in sequence (WP01 → WP02 → WP03 → WP04 → WP05)
**Ready for**: `spec-kitty implement WP01` to begin implementation phase
