## WP01 — Wave 1 foundation: ADR + lint built-in fallback (FR-001..FR-004)

**Priority**: P0 (blocks Wave 1 follow-on WPs)
**Independent test**: `pytest tests/specify_cli/charter_lint/test_engine.py -v` passes with new `graph_state` assertions; `spec-kitty charter lint --json` on a fixture with no project DRG emits `graph_state: "built_in_only"`.
**Estimated prompt size**: ~260 lines
**Linked issue**: #1099
**Prompt file**: `tasks/WP01-wave1-foundation-and-lint-built-in-fallback.md`

Subtasks:
- [ ] T001 ADR-1 (`2026-05-DD-1-charter-freshness-ux-contract.md`) — DIR-003 (WP01)
- [ ] T002 DIR-013 baseline pytest run (WP01)
- [ ] T003 DIR-012 assign #1099 to HiC (WP01)

## WP02 — Wave 1: status freshness + synthesize post-condition (FR-005, FR-009)

**Priority**: P0
**Independent test**: `spec-kitty charter status --json` exposes `freshness` sub-object with three sub-states; synthesize on fresh checkout either produces `graph.yaml` or writes `built_in_only: true` atomically.
**Estimated prompt size**: ~250 lines
**Linked issues**: #1101, #1104
**Prompt file**: `tasks/WP02-wave1-status-freshness-and-synthesize-post-condition.md`

Subtasks:
- [ ] T008 DIR-012 assign #1101, #1104 to HiC (WP02)
- [ ] T009 Hash/timestamp freshness computation (WP02)
- [ ] T010 Wire freshness sub-payload into status --json (WP02)

Dependencies: WP01.

## WP03 — Wave 2: charter_preflight package + CLI (FR-006, FR-007, FR-008)

**Priority**: P0
**Independent test**: `spec-kitty charter preflight --json` returns deterministic JSON; `--auto-refresh` honours the safety rule against uncommitted artifacts; warm run completes in <300 ms.
**Estimated prompt size**: ~290 lines
**Linked issue**: #1100
**Prompt file**: `tasks/WP03-wave2-charter-preflight-package-and-cli.md`

Subtasks:

- [ ] T016 result.py: CharterPreflightCheck/Result dataclasses (WP03)
- [ ] T017 runner.py: run_charter_preflight consumes WP02 freshness (WP03)
- [ ] T018 Uncommitted-artifact detection via git status --porcelain (WP03)
- [ ] T019 Auto-refresh sequence wiring (WP03)
- [ ] T020 cli.py for spec-kitty charter preflight (WP03)

Dependencies: WP02.

---

## WP04 — Wave 2: preflight hook integration

**Priority**: P0
**Independent test**: `spec-kitty next` and `spec-kitty implement` abort cleanly on preflight failure without mutating worktrees; dashboard renders critical banner on failure.
**Estimated prompt size**: ~200 lines

Subtasks:
- [ ] T022 preflight.auto_refresh config flag (WP04)

Dependencies: WP03.

## WP05 — Wave 3: schema field additions (FR-010, FR-011)

**Priority**: P0
**Independent test**: All 5 affected Pydantic models accept `overrides:` and `enhances:` optional fields; cross-field validator rejects both-set case; pack tactic loading regression suite passes.
**Estimated prompt size**: ~320 lines
**Linked issue**: #1291
**Prompt file**: `tasks/WP05-wave3-schema-field-additions.md`

Subtasks:
- [ ] T027 ADR-2 (`2026-05-DD-2-pack-augmentation-vocabulary.md`) (WP05)
- [ ] T028 DIR-012 assign #1291 to HiC (WP05)
- [ ] T029 Glossary entries for enhances/overrides (DIR-032) (WP05)
- [ ] T030 [P] Tactic model + schema YAML (WP05)
- [ ] T031 [P] Styleguide model + schema YAML (WP05)
- [ ] T032 [P] Paradigm model + schema YAML (WP05)
- [ ] T033 [P] Procedure model + schema YAML (WP05)
- [ ] T034 [P] AgentProfile model + schema YAML (WP05)

Dependencies: none (runs parallel with Waves 1-2).

## WP06 — Wave 3: Relation enum + DRG auto-emit + validator (FR-012, FR-013, FR-014)

**Priority**: P0
**Independent test**: Pack tactic declaring `enhances:` against a known built-in passes validation without advisory and auto-emits `ENHANCES` DRG edge; declaring against unknown ID errors with `unknown_target`.
**Estimated prompt size**: ~250 lines
**Linked issue**: #1291
**Prompt file**: `tasks/WP06-wave3-relation-enum-drg-and-validator-advisory.md`

Subtasks:
- [ ] T035 Relation enum: add ENHANCES, OVERRIDES (WP06)
- [ ] T036 org_pack_loader: auto-emit edges (WP06)
- [ ] T037 pack_validator advisory branching (WP06)
- [ ] T038 unknown_target + intent_conflict validator categories (WP06)

## WP07 — Wave 4: bulk-edit cutover (code) (FR-015 a-d)

**Priority**: P1
**Independent test**: `grep -rn '"shipped"\|'\''shipped'\''' src/ | grep -v __pycache__` returns 0 matches; `ruff check` and `mypy --strict` pass.
**Estimated prompt size**: ~270 lines
**Prompt file**: `tasks/WP07-wave4-bulk-edit-cutover-code.md`

Subtasks:
- [ ] T040 ADR-3 (`2026-05-DD-3-shipped-to-built-in-cutover.md`) (WP07)

## WP08 — Wave 4: bulk-edit cutover (tests + architectural regression) (FR-015 e, FR-016)

**Priority**: P1
**Independent test**: Full pytest suite passes with zero regressions (NFR-003); new architectural test `test_no_shipped_layer_label.py` scans 5 public JSON surfaces and finds no `"shipped"`.
**Estimated prompt size**: ~220 lines
**Prompt file**: `tasks/WP08-wave4-bulk-edit-cutover-tests.md`

Subtasks:
- [ ] T046 Migrate tests/specify_cli/ assertions (WP08)

---

## WP09 — Wave 4: docs + CHANGELOG + cross-references (FR-015 f, FR-017)

**Priority**: P1
**Independent test**: `docs/` text + schema descriptions contain no `shipped` as layer label; CHANGELOG entry exists for the JSON breaking change; new ADRs reference `2026-05-16-1`.
**Estimated prompt size**: ~190 lines
**Prompt file**: `tasks/WP09-wave4-docs-and-changelog.md`

Subtasks:

## WP10 — Polish: end-to-end smoke + field-merge edge case fixture

**Priority**: P2
**Independent test**: Quickstart Steps 1-5 produce expected output on a fresh-clone fixture; `test_pack_enhances_partial_fields.py` passes.
**Estimated prompt size**: ~170 lines
**Prompt file**: `tasks/WP10-polish-smoke-and-field-merge-fixture.md`

Subtasks:
- [ ] T055 End-to-end quickstart smoke (WP10)
- [ ] T056 Close-comment on linked issues with PR link (WP10)
- [ ] T057 New field-merge edge case fixture (WP10)

Dependencies: WP08, WP09.

---

## Parallelisation highlights

- **Independent waves**: WP05 (Wave 3 schema) can run in parallel with WP01..WP04. The doctrine package surface does not overlap with the charter CLI surface.
- **In-WP parallel subtasks**: WP05 T030-T034 are five symmetric model+schema changes safely runnable in parallel because each touches an isolated file pair.
- **WP07/WP08/WP09 are sequenced** because they share the bulk-edit gate and pytest baseline.

## MVP scope recommendation

WP01 → WP02 → WP03 → WP04 (Waves 1-2 only) constitutes the MVP that closes the four Slice A launch-blocker issues (#1099, #1100, #1101, #1104). Waves 3-4 close #1291 and the vocabulary cleanup; they can ship in a follow-up release if the MVP needs to ship first.
