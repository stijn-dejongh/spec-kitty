## ⚡ Do This First: Load Agent Profile

Invoke `/ad-hoc-profile-load` with argument `python-pedro` before reading further. Pedro's pytest + refactor domains drive the test-assertion sweep and the new architectural regression test. The `spec-kitty-bulk-edit-classification` skill remains active for Wave 4.

## Objective

Migrate all test assertions across `tests/` that reference `"shipped"` (as layer label or JSON value) to `"built-in"`, per `occurrence_map.yaml` `tests_fixtures` action. Then add the architectural regression test (FR-016) that scans the 5 public JSON surfaces and refuses to merge any future drift back to `"shipped"`. Bring the full pytest suite to zero failures (NFR-003).

## Branch strategy

- Planning base branch: `main`
- Merge target branch: `main`
- Execution worktree: allocated by `finalize-tasks`.

## Context

- `kitty-specs/.../occurrence_map.yaml` — `tests_fixtures` row authoritative
- `kitty-specs/.../spec.md` — FR-015 e, FR-016, NFR-003
- `kitty-specs/.../plan.md` — Cross-cutting Architectural-test-FR-016 row enumerates the 5 JSON surfaces
- WP07 has landed; cross-cutting test failures are expected baseline going into this WP.

## Subtask details

### T046 — Migrate `tests/specify_cli/` assertions

**Files**: every test file under `tests/specify_cli/` that pattern-matches `shipped` per `grep -rn '"shipped"\|'\''shipped'\''' tests/specify_cli/ --include='*.py'`.

Action per occurrence_map row: replace literal `"shipped"` with `"built-in"` in assertions where the value represents a layer label. Cases:
- Banner output assertions (e.g. `assert "[built-in]" in result.stdout`).
- JSON assertions (e.g. `assert payload["source"] == "built-in"`).
- Provenance string comparisons.

Comments and docstrings inside tests that explain the concept can use either "built-in" or descriptive prose — use occurrence_map's `update-in-place` action discretion.

### T047 — Migrate `tests/integration/` + `tests/architectural/` assertions

**Files**: same pattern, scoped to `tests/integration/` and `tests/architectural/`.

Particular files to check:
- `tests/integration/test_charter_lint_lints_all_layers.py`
- `tests/integration/test_charter_status_reports_three_layers.py`
- `tests/architectural/*` (verify no architectural test currently asserts `"shipped"` is canonical)

### T048 — Migrate `tests/test_dashboard/` + remaining

**Files**: `tests/test_dashboard/` and any other test directory still containing `shipped` per grep sweep.

The dashboard API tests (`tests/test_dashboard/test_api_charter.py`) may serialise the layer label in API responses — assertions need updating.

### T049 — Full pytest zero-failures check (NFR-003)

Run `PWHEADLESS=1 pytest tests/ -q --tb=short` and ensure zero failures. Compare against the DIR-013 baseline established in WP01. Any *new* failure introduced by this mission is a regression that MUST be fixed before merge.

If a pre-existing baseline failure (from WP01 T002) re-surfaces, document the cross-reference in the WP completion notes — do not "fix" pre-existing failures here.

### T050 — Architectural regression test FR-016

**Files**: NEW `tests/architectural/test_no_shipped_layer_label.py`

Implement the test enumerated in `plan.md` Cross-cutting Architectural-test row. Scan the JSON output of 5 public surfaces:

```python
import json, subprocess, pytest
from pathlib import Path

FORBIDDEN_LAYER_LABEL = "shipped"  # legacy term — must not surface as a layer label
SURFACES = [
    ["spec-kitty", "charter", "status", "--json"],
    ["spec-kitty", "charter", "lint", "--json"],
    ["spec-kitty", "charter", "preflight", "--json"],
    ["spec-kitty", "agent", "profile", "list", "--json"],
    # the 5th surface (pack validate) is exercised against a fixture pack
]

@pytest.mark.parametrize("cmd", SURFACES)
def test_public_json_surface_has_no_shipped_layer_label(cmd, tmp_repo):
    proc = subprocess.run(cmd, cwd=tmp_repo, capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=10.0)
    assert proc.returncode in (0, 1), f"unexpected exit {proc.returncode}"
    if not proc.stdout.strip():
        pytest.skip(f"{cmd} produced no JSON in {tmp_repo}")
    payload = json.loads(proc.stdout)
    flat = json.dumps(payload)
    assert FORBIDDEN_LAYER_LABEL not in _layer_label_values(payload), (
        f"public CLI surface still emits {FORBIDDEN_LAYER_LABEL!r} as a layer label: "
        f"{cmd}\n{flat[:500]}"
    )
```

Where `_layer_label_values(payload)` walks the JSON and yields string values that occupy a layer-label position (source field, layer field, provenance field). Be deliberate: searching the entire JSON for the substring `shipped` may produce false positives (e.g., legitimate prose). The test scans **values at known layer-label keys** only.

Pack-validate surface (the 5th): run `spec-kitty doctrine pack validate <fixture-pack> --json` against a fixture pack created in the test (or in `tests/fixtures/`), and apply the same check to issue messages.

Mark the test in CI so it cannot be skipped silently.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Zero occurrences of literal `"shipped"` as a layer-label assertion in `tests/`.
- [ ] `pytest tests/ -q` reports zero failures (matching or improving on DIR-013 baseline).
- [ ] `tests/architectural/test_no_shipped_layer_label.py` exists and exercises 5 surfaces.
- [ ] `mypy --strict` and `ruff check` pass.

## Risks

- **Cross-WP coordination**: WP07's commits may have left some test files broken. WP08 fixes them — work in a single coherent commit per test directory.
- **Dashboard API**: `tests/test_dashboard/test_api_charter.py` may rely on SPA support. Defer SPA fixes if they exist; the API assertion is what counts here.
- **Subprocess in architectural test**: if the test environment can't spawn `spec-kitty` subprocesses (some CI setups limit this), invoke the typer app directly via `CliRunner` instead.

## Reviewer guidance

1. Verify NFR-003 (zero regressions vs DIR-013 baseline) via the pytest summary.
2. Verify the new architectural test exercises all 5 surfaces and does not skip silently.
3. Spot-check the `_layer_label_values` helper to ensure it doesn't false-positive on legitimate prose.
