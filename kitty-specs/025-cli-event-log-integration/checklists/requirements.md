# Specification Quality Checklist: CLI Event Log Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Status**: ✅ PASSED - Ready for `/spec-kitty.plan`

## Content Quality

- [✅] No implementation details in success criteria (user-focused outcomes)
- [✅] Focused on user value and business needs (SaaS foundation, conflict detection, parallel workflows)
- [⚠️] Written for non-technical stakeholders (Note: This is a developer-facing infrastructure feature, so technical details are appropriate)
- [✅] All mandatory sections completed (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions)

## Requirement Completeness

- [✅] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [✅] Requirements are testable and unambiguous (all use MUST with concrete verification criteria)
- [✅] Success criteria are measurable (100% coverage, <500ms, zero regressions)
- [✅] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focused on developer experience, not tech stack)
- [✅] All acceptance scenarios are defined (7 user stories with Given/When/Then scenarios)
- [✅] Edge cases are identified (6 edge cases covering corruption, conflicts, concurrency)
- [✅] Scope is clearly bounded ("Out of Scope" section: vendoring, 1.x migration)
- [✅] Dependencies and assumptions identified (7 assumptions including Git, POSIX, SQLite)

## Feature Readiness

- [✅] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria (28 FRs with MUST statements)
- [✅] User scenarios cover primary flows (P1: emission, reading, indexing, dependency; P2: conflicts, rotation, errors)
- [✅] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (8 measurable outcomes)
- [⚠️] No implementation details leak into specification (Note: Technical infrastructure feature necessarily mentions technologies like Lamport clocks, event sourcing - this is the WHAT, not the HOW)

## Notes

### Validation Summary

All critical checklist items passed. Specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for implementation planning.

### Technical Details Justification

This is a **technical infrastructure feature** where the "what" (integrate event sourcing library) is inherently technical. The success criteria are now user-focused (developer experience), but functional requirements necessarily mention specific technologies (JSONL storage, Lamport clocks, CRDT merge rules) because that IS what the feature delivers.

Compare to Feature 015 (Jujutsu Integration): similarly technical feature where mentioning "jj" and "git" is unavoidable because the feature IS about integrating those tools.

### Next Steps

✅ Ready for `/spec-kitty.plan` - no spec updates required
