## Review Feedback

**Reviewed by**: Robert Douglass
**Status**: ❌ Changes Requested
**Date**: 2026-01-30

**Issue 1 (blocking): `specify_cli.events` now imports symbols that don't exist**
- `src/specify_cli/events/__init__.py` imports `generate_ulid` and `with_event_store`, but there is no `generate_ulid` in `adapter.py` and no `middleware.py` in `src/specify_cli/events/`. This makes `import specify_cli.events` crash at import time.
- Fix: restore the missing module/function from WP03, or remove the imports and re‑add the real implementations before exporting.

**Issue 2 (blocking): `reconstruct_all_wp_statuses` has a NameError and still misses WPs without events**
- The updated signature uses `repo_root: Path | None`, but `Path` is not imported in `src/specify_cli/events/reader.py`, so calling the method raises `NameError: name 'Path' is not defined`.
- The seeding logic only runs when `feature_slug` is provided; however the WP05 E2E test calls `spec-kitty status` without `--feature` and expects WPs with no events (e.g., WP03) to appear as `planned`. With `feature=None`, you still return only WPs that have events.
- Fix: import `Path`, and seed planned WPs even when no feature filter is provided (e.g., discover all `kitty-specs/*/tasks/WP*.md` and default to planned, then overlay events).

**Dependency check:** WP04 is still not merged to `main` and has review feedback. WP05 should rebase onto the finalized WP04 once it lands.

## Objectives & Success Criteria

**Primary Goal**: Implement event reading with Lamport clock ordering and state reconstruction from event history.

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ EventStore.read() with optional filters (delegates to index)
- ✅ Events sorted by Lamport clock (causal ordering, not timestamps)
- ✅ Graceful degradation (skip invalid JSON lines with warnings)
- ✅ State reconstruction logic (replay events to derive current status)
- ✅ `spec-kitty status` command reads from event log (not YAML)
- ✅ Fallback to direct JSONL reading when index unavailable
- ✅ 100% accurate state reconstruction (US2 requirement)

**Priority**: P1 (US2)

**User Story**: US2 - Reading Workflow State from Event Log

**Independent Test**:
```bash
# Setup: Emit several WPStatusChanged events
cd /tmp/test-reconstruction
spec-kitty init
spec-kitty agent feature setup-spec --slug 999-test

# Manually emit events (simulating state changes)
python3 << 'EOF'
from specify_cli.events.store import EventStore
from pathlib import Path

store = EventStore(Path("."))

# WP01: planned → doing → for_review
store.emit("WPStatusChanged", "WP01", "WorkPackage", "test", {"old_status": "planned", "new_status": "doing"})
store.emit("WPStatusChanged", "WP01", "WorkPackage", "test", {"old_status": "doing", "new_status": "for_review"})

# WP02: planned → doing
store.emit("WPStatusChanged", "WP02", "WorkPackage", "test", {"old_status": "planned", "new_status": "doing"})

print("✓ Events emitted")
EOF

# Run status command (should reconstruct state from events)
spec-kitty status
# Expected output:
# Planned: []
# Doing: [WP02]
# For Review: [WP01]
# Done: []
```

---

## Context & Constraints

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Target Branch

**This work package MUST be implemented on the `2.x` branch (NOT main).**

Verify you're on 2.x:
```bash
git branch --show-current  # Must output: 2.x
```

### Prerequisites

- **WP04 complete**: EventStore.read() partially implemented, needs event parsing
- **Data model**: `kitty-specs/025-cli-event-log-integration/data-model.md` (lines 165-180 for read(), lines 292-325 for state reconstruction)
- **Spec**: US2 acceptance scenarios (lines 50-55)
- **Quickstart**: Event reading example (lines 109-146)

### Architectural Constraints

**From data-model.md (State Reconstruction)**:
- Current state = replay all events in causal order (Lamport clock, not timestamp)
- Apply state-machine pattern (old_status → new_status transitions)
- Start from default state (e.g., "planned" for WorkPackages)

**From spec.md (US2)**:
- Must handle out-of-order events (sort by Lamport clock)
- Must handle missing event log gracefully (empty board)
- Must skip invalid JSON lines with warning (graceful degradation)

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Causal Ordering** (FR-013): Sort by lamport_clock field, not timestamp
2. **Graceful Degradation** (FR-016): Skip invalid JSON, log warning, continue
3. **State Machine** (data-model): Apply transitions sequentially (old → new status)

## Subtasks & Detailed Guidance

### Subtask T025 – Implement EventStore.read() with optional filters (delegates to index)

**Purpose**: This was partially implemented in WP04 T024. Now complete it with full event parsing.

**Steps**:

1. **Verify WP04 T024 implementation**:
   ```python
   # In src/specify_cli/events/store.py
   # Should already have read() method from WP04 T024

   def read(
       self,
       entity_id: str | None = None,
       event_type: str | None = None,
       since_clock: int | None = None,
   ) -> list[Event]:
       """
       Read events from log, optionally filtered.

       (Already implemented in WP04 T024)
       """
       # Implementation exists - verify it works
   ```

2. **Add comprehensive docstring**:
   ```python
   def read(
       self,
       entity_id: str | None = None,
       event_type: str | None = None,
       since_clock: int | None = None,
   ) -> list[Event]:
       """
       Read events from log, optionally filtered.

       Uses SQLite index if filters provided AND index is healthy.
       Falls back to direct JSONL reading if index missing/corrupted.

       Args:
           entity_id: Filter by entity (e.g., "WP01")
           event_type: Filter by event type (e.g., "WPStatusChanged")
           since_clock: Filter by Lamport clock (events after this value)

       Returns:
           List of Event objects, sorted by lamport_clock (causal order)

       Examples:
           # Read all WPStatusChanged events for WP01
           events = store.read(entity_id="WP01", event_type="WPStatusChanged")

           # Read all events since clock 42
           events = store.read(since_clock=42)

           # Read all events (unfiltered)
           events = store.read()
       """
       # ... existing implementation from WP04 T024
   ```

**Files**:
- `src/specify_cli/events/store.py` (verify: read() method exists from WP04)

**Validation**:
- [ ] `read()` exists and works (from WP04)
- [ ] Returns list[Event] sorted by lamport_clock
- [ ] Delegates to index when filters provided
- [ ] Falls back to direct JSONL when index unavailable

**Edge Cases**: (Already handled in WP04)

**Parallel?**: No - Verification of WP04 work

### Subtask T026 – Implement event sorting by Lamport clock (causal ordering)

**Purpose**: Ensure events are always sorted by Lamport clock, not timestamp, for correct causal ordering.

**Steps**:

1. **Verify sorting in EventStore.read()**:
   ```python
   # In src/specify_cli/events/store.py
   # Should already have sorting at end of read() method

   def read(...) -> list[Event]:
       # ... existing read logic

       # Sort by Lamport clock (causal order)
       events.sort(key=lambda e: e.lamport_clock)

       return events
   ```

2. **Add validation test**:
   ```python
   # Test script to verify causal ordering
   from specify_cli.events.store import EventStore
   from pathlib import Path
   from datetime import datetime, timezone, timedelta

   store = EventStore(Path("/tmp/test-causal-order"))

   # Emit events with timestamps OUT OF ORDER but Lamport clocks IN ORDER
   # (Simulating clock skew scenario)
   future_time = (datetime.now(timezone.utc) + timedelta(hours=1)).isoformat()
   past_time = (datetime.now(timezone.utc) - timedelta(hours=1)).isoformat()

   # Event 1: clock=1, timestamp=future (out of order)
   event1 = store.emit("Test", "WP01", "WP", "test", {"order": 1})
   # Manually set timestamp to future (for testing)
   # (In reality, would need to modify emit() temporarily)

   # Event 2: clock=2, timestamp=past (out of order)
   event2 = store.emit("Test", "WP01", "WP", "test", {"order": 2})

   # Read events
   events = store.read(entity_id="WP01")

   # Verify sorted by clock (not timestamp)
   assert events[0].lamport_clock == 1, "First event should have clock=1"
   assert events[1].lamport_clock == 2, "Second event should have clock=2"
   print("✓ Events correctly sorted by Lamport clock (causal order)")
   ```

**Files**:
- `src/specify_cli/events/store.py` (verify: sorting by lamport_clock exists)

**Validation**:
- [ ] Events sorted by `lamport_clock` field (not `timestamp`)
- [ ] Sorting is stable (events with same clock maintain relative order)
- [ ] Test with out-of-order timestamps validates causal ordering

**Edge Cases**:
- Events with same Lamport clock: Stable sort maintains emission order (tie-breaking by event_id lexicographic if needed)
- Empty event list: Sorted list is still empty (no-op)

**Parallel?**: No - Verification of WP04 work

### Subtask T027 – Implement graceful degradation (skip invalid JSON lines with warnings)

**Purpose**: Handle corrupted JSONL files without crashing, enabling partial data recovery.

**Steps**:

1. **Verify graceful degradation in _read_jsonl_file()**:
   ```python
   # In src/specify_cli/events/store.py
   # Should already have graceful degradation from WP04

   import json
   import sys

   def _read_jsonl_file(self, jsonl_file: Path) -> list[Event]:
       """Read events from a single JSONL file with graceful degradation."""
       events = []
       for line_num, line in enumerate(jsonl_file.read_text().splitlines(), 1):
           if not line.strip():
               continue  # Skip empty lines

           try:
               events.append(Event.from_json(line))
           except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
               # Graceful degradation: skip invalid JSON
               print(
                   f"⚠️ Skipping invalid JSON in {jsonl_file.name}:{line_num}: {e}",
                   file=sys.stderr
               )
           except (ValueError, KeyError) as e:
               # Event validation failed (missing required fields)
               print(
                   f"⚠️ Skipping invalid event in {jsonl_file.name}:{line_num}: {e}",
                   file=sys.stderr
               )

       return events
   ```

2. **Test graceful degradation**:
   ```bash
   # Create JSONL file with mixed valid/invalid lines
   cat > /tmp/test-degradation/.kittify/events/2026-01-27.jsonl << 'EOF'
   {"event_id": "01TEST1", "event_type": "Test", "event_version": 1, "lamport_clock": 1, "entity_id": "WP01", "entity_type": "WP", "timestamp": "2026-01-27T10:00:00Z", "actor": "test", "causation_id": null, "correlation_id": null, "payload": {}}
   {"invalid json - missing braces
   {"event_id": "01TEST2", "event_type": "Test", "event_version": 1, "lamport_clock": 2, "entity_id": "WP01", "entity_type": "WP", "timestamp": "2026-01-27T10:01:00Z", "actor": "test", "causation_id": null, "correlation_id": null, "payload": {}}
   EOF

   # Read events (should skip invalid line, log warning)
   python3 << 'PYTHON'
   from specify_cli.events.store import EventStore
   from pathlib import Path
   store = EventStore(Path("/tmp/test-degradation"))
   events = store.read()
   print(f"Read {len(events)} events (should be 2, skipped 1 invalid)")
   assert len(events) == 2
   PYTHON
   ```

**Files**:
- `src/specify_cli/events/store.py` (verify: graceful degradation exists from WP04)

**Validation**:
- [ ] Invalid JSON lines skipped with warning (not raised as exception)
- [ ] Warning includes filename and line number for debugging
- [ ] Valid events before/after invalid line are still read
- [ ] Empty lines skipped silently (no warning)

**Edge Cases**:
- Entire file corrupted: Returns empty list, logs warning for each line
- Missing required fields: ValueError caught, logged, line skipped
- Extra fields in JSON: Tolerated (weak schema in Event.from_json)

**Parallel?**: No - Verification of WP04 work

### Subtask T028 – Create state reconstruction logic (replay events to derive current status)

**Purpose**: Implement the core state machine logic to derive current WorkPackage status from event history.

**Steps**:

1. **Create reader module**:
   ```python
   # src/specify_cli/events/reader.py (new file)

   from typing import Any
   from specify_cli.events.types import Event
   from specify_cli.events.store import EventStore
   from pathlib import Path


   class EventReader:
       """

**Files**:
- `src/specify_cli/events/reader.py` (new file, ~150 lines)

**Validation**:
- [ ] `reconstruct_wp_status()` replays events to derive current status
- [ ] Events processed in Lamport clock order (causal)
- [ ] Default status is "planned" (before any events)
- [ ] `reconstruct_all_wp_statuses()` returns dict mapping WP ID → status
- [ ] `get_wp_history()` returns full transition log

**Edge Cases**:
- No events for WP: Returns "planned" (default)
- Events missing `new_status` in payload: Ignored (status unchanged)
- Multiple features with same WP ID: Filtered by feature_slug

**Parallel?**: Yes - Can implement in parallel with T025-T027 (separate module)

### Subtask T029 – Integrate event reading into `spec-kitty status` command

**Purpose**: Replace YAML activity log reading with event log reading in status command.

**Steps**:

1. **Locate status command**:
   ```bash
   find src -name "*status*" -type f | xargs grep -l "spec-kitty status"
   # Likely in: src/specify_cli/cli/commands/status.py
   ```

2. **Modify status command to use EventReader**:
   ```python
   # In src/specify_cli/cli/commands/status.py (modify)

   from specify_cli.events.middleware import with_event_store
   from specify_cli.events.store import EventStore
   from specify_cli.events.reader import EventReader

   @with_event_store
   def status(
       feature: str | None,
       event_store: EventStore,  # Injected
   ):
       """
       Display project status (kanban board).

       Reads state from event log (not YAML activity logs).
       """
       # Initialize reader
       reader = EventReader(event_store)

       # Reconstruct all WP statuses from events
       try:
           wp_statuses = reader.reconstruct_all_wp_statuses(feature_slug=feature)
       except Exception as e:
           import sys
           print(f"⚠️ Failed to read event log: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
           print("Displaying empty board.", file=sys.stderr)
           wp_statuses = {}

       # Group WPs by status (kanban lanes)
       lanes = {
           "planned": [],
           "doing": [],
           "for_review": [],
           "done": [],
           "rejected": [],
       }

       for wp_id, status in wp_statuses.items():
           if status in lanes:
               lanes[status].append(wp_id)
           else:
               # Unknown status - put in planned
               lanes["planned"].append(wp_id)

       # Display kanban board (existing logic)
       display_kanban_board(lanes, feature_filter=feature)
   ```

3. **Handle empty event log gracefully**:
   ```python
   # Add fallback for fresh projects (no events yet)
   if not wp_statuses:
       print("No events found. Project may be newly initialized.")
       print("Displaying empty board.")
       # Display empty board (all lanes empty)
       display_kanban_board({"planned": [], "doing": [], "for_review": [], "done": [], "rejected": []})
   ```

**Files**:
- `src/specify_cli/cli/commands/status.py` (modify: use EventReader instead of YAML)

**Validation**:
- [ ] `status` command decorated with `@with_event_store`
- [ ] Uses `EventReader.reconstruct_all_wp_statuses()` to derive state
- [ ] Groups WPs by status (kanban lanes)
- [ ] Displays kanban board with correct WP positions
- [ ] Handles empty event log gracefully (empty board)
- [ ] Test: Run `spec-kitty status` after emitting events, verify board reflects state

**Edge Cases**:
- No events exist: Displays empty board with message
- Event reading fails: Logs warning, displays empty board
- Unknown status in event: WP placed in "planned" lane (fallback)

**Parallel?**: No - Sequential after T028 (needs EventReader)

### Subtask T030 – Add fallback to direct JSONL reading when index unavailable

**Purpose**: This was already implemented in WP04 T024. Verify it works.

**Steps**:

1. **Verify fallback in EventStore.read()**:
   ```python
   # In src/specify_cli/events/store.py
   # Should already have fallback logic from WP04

   def read(...) -> list[Event]:
       # ... existing logic

       if use_index and self.index.exists():
           # Use index
       else:
           # Fallback to direct JSONL reading
           events = self._read_all_jsonl()
           events = self._filter_events(events, entity_id, event_type, since_clock)
   ```

2. **Test fallback behavior**:
   ```bash
   # Setup project with events
   cd /tmp/test-fallback
   spec-kitty init
   # ... emit some events ...

   # Delete index database
   rm .kittify/events/index.db

   # Run status (should fallback to direct JSONL)
   spec-kitty status
   # Should work (slower but functional)
   ```

**Files**:
- `src/specify_cli/events/store.py` (verify: fallback exists from WP04)

**Validation**:
- [ ] Fallback to `_read_all_jsonl()` when index missing
- [ ] Direct JSONL reading still works (slower but functional)
- [ ] Warning logged if index unavailable

**Edge Cases**: (Already handled in WP04)

**Parallel?**: No - Verification of WP04 work

---

## Test Strategy

**No separate test files** (constitution: tests not explicitly requested).

**Validation approach**:
1. **T025-T027**: Verification - Confirm WP04 implementation works
2. **T028**: Unit test - Reconstruct status from test events
3. **T029**: Integration test - `spec-kitty status` displays correct board
4. **T030**: Fallback test - Delete index, verify status still works

**End-to-end test** (covers all subtasks):
```bash
# Setup fresh project
cd /tmp/test-e2e-reading
git init
spec-kitty init

# Emit events for multiple WPs
python3 << 'EOF'
from specify_cli.events.store import EventStore
from pathlib import Path

store = EventStore(Path("."))

# WP01: planned → doing → for_review → done
store.emit("WPStatusChanged", "WP01", "WorkPackage", "agent1", {"feature_slug": "test", "old_status": "planned", "new_status": "doing"})
store.emit("WPStatusChanged", "WP01", "WorkPackage", "agent1", {"feature_slug": "test", "old_status": "doing", "new_status": "for_review"})
store.emit("WPStatusChanged", "WP01", "WorkPackage", "agent1", {"feature_slug": "test", "old_status": "for_review", "new_status": "done"})

# WP02: planned → doing
store.emit("WPStatusChanged", "WP02", "WorkPackage", "agent2", {"feature_slug": "test", "old_status": "planned", "new_status": "doing"})

# WP03: planned
# (no events - should default to planned)

print("✓ Emitted 4 events")
EOF

# Run status command
spec-kitty status

# Expected output:
# ┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
# │ Planned     │ Doing       │ For Review  │ Done        │
# ├─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤
# │ WP03        │ WP02        │             │ WP01        │
# └─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘

# Test reconstruction accuracy
python3 << 'EOF'
from specify_cli.events.store import EventStore
from specify_cli.events.reader import EventReader
from pathlib import Path

store = EventStore(Path("."))
reader = EventReader(store)

statuses = reader.reconstruct_all_wp_statuses()
assert statuses["WP01"] == "done", f"WP01 status wrong: {statuses.get('WP01')}"
assert statuses["WP02"] == "doing", f"WP02 status wrong: {statuses.get('WP02')}"
print("✓ State reconstruction 100% accurate")
EOF

# Test fallback (delete index, verify still works)
rm .kittify/events/index.db
spec-kitty status  # Should still work (slower)

echo "✓ End-to-end test passed"
```

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: State reconstruction produces incorrect results

**Impact**: Violates US2 requirement (100% accuracy)

**Mitigation**:
- T028 implements simple state-machine logic (last new_status wins)
- T026 ensures causal ordering (Lamport clock sort)
- Integration test validates reconstruction accuracy

### Risk 2: Direct JSONL reading is too slow

**Impact**: Fallback mode has poor UX (>2 seconds for status command)

**Mitigation**:
- T030 fallback is edge case (index usually available)
- Direct JSONL reading still acceptable for small projects (<100 events)
- Users can rebuild index manually if needed

### Risk 3: Invalid events break state reconstruction

**Impact**: Status command crashes on corrupted event log

**Mitigation**:
- T027 graceful degradation (skip invalid events)
- T028 tolerates missing payload fields (uses .get() with defaults)
- T029 wraps reconstruction in try/except (empty board on failure)

## Definition of Done Checklist

- [ ] T025: EventStore.read() verified working (from WP04)
- [ ] T026: Events sorted by lamport_clock (causal ordering)
- [ ] T027: Graceful degradation verified (skips invalid JSON)
- [ ] T028: EventReader class with reconstruct_wp_status() and reconstruct_all_wp_statuses()
- [ ] T028: State reconstruction replays events in causal order
- [ ] T029: `spec-kitty status` uses EventReader (not YAML)
- [ ] T029: Kanban board reflects current state from events
- [ ] T029: Handles empty event log gracefully
- [ ] T030: Fallback to direct JSONL verified (from WP04)
- [ ] End-to-end test passes (emits events, status command shows correct board)
- [ ] State reconstruction 100% accurate (matches event history)

---

## Review Guidance

**Key Acceptance Checkpoints**:

1. **T025-T027 - Read Infrastructure**:
   - ✓ read() method works with filters
   - ✓ Events sorted by lamport_clock
   - ✓ Invalid JSON skipped with warning

2. **T028 - State Reconstruction**:
   - ✓ Replays events in causal order
   - ✓ Default status is "planned"
   - ✓ Last new_status wins (state-machine)
   - ✓ get_wp_history() returns full transition log

3. **T029 - Status Command**:
   - ✓ Uses EventReader (not YAML)
   - ✓ Displays kanban board correctly
   - ✓ Handles empty event log gracefully

4. **T030 - Fallback**:
   - ✓ Works when index missing (slower but functional)

**Reviewers should**:
- Run end-to-end test (verify board reflects events)
- Test reconstruction accuracy (compare with manual calculation)
- Delete index and verify fallback works

## Implementation Command

This WP depends on WP04. Implement from WP04's branch:

```bash
spec-kitty implement WP05 --base WP04
```

This will create workspace: `.worktrees/025-cli-event-log-integration-WP05/` branched from WP04.
