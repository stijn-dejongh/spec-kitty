## Review Feedback

**Reviewed by**: Robert Douglass
**Status**: ❌ Changes Requested
**Date**: 2026-01-17

**Issue 1**: `spec-kitty init` VCS detection order is still inaccurate and contradictory. The section says “When `--vcs` is not specified” but lists `--vcs` as step 1 and omits the mismatch error behavior. Please align this with the actual rules (explicit backend first; conflicting `--vcs` vs feature lock errors; then feature `meta.json`, then tool availability). Update `docs/reference/cli-commands.md:72` to match the configuration docs.

## Objectives & Success Criteria

- Add complete reference documentation for `spec-kitty sync` and `spec-kitty ops` commands
- Document the new `--vcs` flag for `spec-kitty init`
- Update file-structure.md and configuration.md with jj-related content
- Success: User can find accurate documentation for all new CLI functionality

## Context & Constraints

- **Spec**: `kitty-specs/016-jujutsu-vcs-documentation/spec.md` - FR-010, FR-011 (command reference)
- **Plan**: `kitty-specs/016-jujutsu-vcs-documentation/plan.md` - Command Documentation Reference section
- **Research**: `kitty-specs/016-jujutsu-vcs-documentation/research.md` - CLI Command Documentation section (verified against --help)

### Command Reference Source (from research.md)

**spec-kitty sync**:
```
Usage: spec-kitty sync [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --repair, -r    Attempt workspace recovery (may lose uncommitted work)
  --verbose, -v   Show detailed sync output

Backend Differences:
  git: Sync may FAIL on conflicts (must resolve before continuing)
  jj:  Sync always SUCCEEDS (conflicts stored, resolve later)
```

**spec-kitty ops**:
```
Usage: spec-kitty ops COMMAND [ARGS]

Commands:
  log      Show operation history
  undo     Undo last operation (jj only)
  restore  Restore to a specific operation (jj only)
```

**spec-kitty ops log**:
```
Options:
  --limit, -n INTEGER   Number of operations to show [default: 20]
  --verbose, -v         Show full operation IDs and details
```

**spec-kitty ops undo**:
```
Arguments:
  operation_id    Operation ID to undo (defaults to last operation)
Backend: jj only
```

**spec-kitty ops restore**:
```
Arguments:
  operation_id    Operation ID to restore to (required)
Backend: jj only
```

**spec-kitty init --vcs**:
```
--vcs TEXT    VCS to use: 'git' or 'jj'. Defaults to jj if available.
```

## Subtasks & Detailed Guidance

### Subtask T004 – Add sync command to cli-commands.md

- **Purpose**: Document the workspace sync command
- **Steps**:
  1. Read `docs/reference/cli-commands.md` to understand existing format
  2. Add new section for `spec-kitty sync`
  3. Include: usage, description, options table, examples, backend difference callout
  4. Cross-reference to `how-to/sync-workspaces.md`
- **Files**: `docs/reference/cli-commands.md`
- **Example format**:
  ```markdown
  ### spec-kitty sync

  Synchronize workspace with upstream changes.

  **Usage**: `spec-kitty sync [OPTIONS]`

  | Option | Short | Description |
  |--------|-------|-------------|
  | `--repair` | `-r` | Attempt workspace recovery |
  | `--verbose` | `-v` | Show detailed output |

  > **jj vs git**: With jj, sync always succeeds...
  ```

### Subtask T005 – Add ops command group to cli-commands.md

- **Purpose**: Document the ops command group overview
- **Steps**:
  1. Add section for `spec-kitty ops`
  2. Describe purpose: operation history and undo capability
  3. List subcommands with brief descriptions
  4. Note that undo/restore are jj-only
- **Files**: `docs/reference/cli-commands.md`

### Subtask T006 – Add ops log subcommand reference

- **Purpose**: Document how to view operation history
- **Steps**:
  1. Add subsection for `spec-kitty ops log`
  2. Include options table (--limit, --verbose)
  3. Add examples showing typical usage
  4. Note backend difference (jj operation log vs git reflog)
- **Files**: `docs/reference/cli-commands.md`

### Subtask T007 – Add ops undo subcommand reference

- **Purpose**: Document how to undo operations
- **Steps**:
  1. Add subsection for `spec-kitty ops undo`
  2. Document arguments (operation_id optional)
  3. Add examples
  4. **Prominently note**: jj only - git does not support undo
- **Files**: `docs/reference/cli-commands.md`

### Subtask T008 – Add ops restore subcommand reference

- **Purpose**: Document how to restore to specific operation
- **Steps**:
  1. Add subsection for `spec-kitty ops restore`
  2. Document required operation_id argument
  3. Explain difference from undo (jump to any point vs last operation)
  4. **Prominently note**: jj only
- **Files**: `docs/reference/cli-commands.md`

### Subtask T009 – Document --vcs flag in init section

- **Purpose**: Update init documentation with new VCS selection flag
- **Steps**:
  1. Find existing `spec-kitty init` section
  2. Add `--vcs` to options table
  3. Document VCS detection order (--vcs flag → meta.json → jj preferred → git fallback)
  4. Add example: `spec-kitty init my-project --vcs git`
- **Files**: `docs/reference/cli-commands.md`

### Subtask T010 – Update file-structure.md for .jj/ directory

- **Purpose**: Document jj directory alongside .git/
- **Steps**:
  1. Read `docs/reference/file-structure.md`
  2. Find section on project structure or VCS directories
  3. Add documentation for `.jj/` directory
  4. Explain colocated mode (both .jj/ and .git/ present)
- **Files**: `docs/reference/file-structure.md`
- **Parallel?**: Yes - different file from T004-T009

### Subtask T011 – Update configuration.md with vcs section

- **Purpose**: Document VCS configuration options
- **Steps**:
  1. Read `docs/reference/configuration.md`
  2. Add section for VCS configuration in `.kittify/config.yaml`:
     ```yaml
     vcs:
       preferred: "auto"  # "auto" | "jj" | "git"
       jj:
         min_version: "0.20.0"
         colocate: true
     ```
  3. Document per-feature VCS lock in meta.json
- **Files**: `docs/reference/configuration.md`
- **Parallel?**: Yes - different file from T004-T010

## Risks & Mitigations

- **CLI output drift**: Documented against research.md which was verified against live CLI
- **Incomplete coverage**: Use spec.md FR-010, FR-011 as checklist

## Definition of Done Checklist

- [ ] T004: sync command fully documented with examples
- [ ] T005: ops command group overview added
- [ ] T006: ops log subcommand documented with options
- [ ] T007: ops undo documented with jj-only note
- [ ] T008: ops restore documented with jj-only note

## Review Guidance

- Verify command syntax matches `spec-kitty <cmd> --help` output
- Check all flags and arguments are documented
