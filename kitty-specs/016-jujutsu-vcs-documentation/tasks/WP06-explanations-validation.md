## Review Feedback

**Reviewed by**: Robert Douglass
**Status**: ❌ Changes Requested
**Date**: 2026-01-17

**Reviewed by**: Claude (automated review)
**Status**: ❌ Changes Requested
**Date**: 2026-01-17

**Issue 1** (VCS detection inconsistency): The "VCS Detection" section in `jujutsu-for-multi-agent.md` (lines 130-134) uses the same oversimplified detection description that was flagged and corrected in WP02's reference documentation. It says:

```
1. If `.jj/` exists → Use jujutsu backend
2. If `.git/` exists → Use git backend
3. Neither → Error
```

This conflicts with the corrected `configuration.md` which documents the actual detection order:
1. Explicit backend (CLI flag)
2. Feature meta.json locked VCS
3. jj preferred if available
4. git fallback

**Fix**: Update lines 130-134 to either (a) reference the configuration.md documentation with a cross-link, or (b) accurately describe the detection order. Example fix:

```markdown
### VCS Detection

Spec Kitty detects your VCS based on CLI flags, feature locks, and tool availability. See [VCS Detection Order](../reference/configuration.md#vcs-detection-order) for the full algorithm.

In most cases:
- New features use jj if installed (preferred for multi-agent workflows)
- Existing features use their locked VCS from meta.json
- `--vcs git` or `--vcs jj` overrides detection
```

## Objectives & Success Criteria

- Create conceptual explanation articles for jj design rationale
- Validate entire documentation build (DocFX, links, search terms)
- Success: Users understand why jj is preferred; docs build and deploy correctly

## Context & Constraints

- **Spec**: `kitty-specs/016-jujutsu-vcs-documentation/spec.md` - User Story 5 (P2), User Story 6 (P1), FR-012, FR-013, FR-014-18
- **Plan**: `kitty-specs/016-jujutsu-vcs-documentation/plan.md` - Verification Checklist section
- **Research**: `kitty-specs/016-jujutsu-vcs-documentation/research.md` - VCS Capabilities Comparison

### Divio Explanation Guidelines

Explanations are:
- **Understanding-oriented**: Help users build mental models
- **Conceptual**: Focus on "why" not "how"
- **Contextual**: Relate to broader system design
- **Connecting**: Link concepts together
- **Discursive**: Can explore alternatives and trade-offs

### Key Concepts to Explain

From research.md and feature 015:
- Why jj for multi-agent development (auto-rebase eliminates coordination)
- How auto-rebase works (jj's change-based model)
- Non-blocking conflicts (stored in files, resolve later)
- Change IDs (stable identity across rebases)
- Operation log (time travel, undo capability)

## Subtasks & Detailed Guidance

### Subtask T032 – Create jujutsu-for-multi-agent.md

- **Purpose**: Explain why spec-kitty prefers jj for multi-agent workflows (FR-012)
- **Steps**:
  1. Create `docs/explanation/jujutsu-for-multi-agent.md`
  2. Title: "Why Jujutsu for Multi-Agent Development"
  3. Structure:
     - **The Problem**: Coordinating multiple agents on dependent work
     - **Git's Limitation**: Manual rebase, blocking conflicts, coordination overhead
     - **jj's Solution**: Auto-rebase, non-blocking conflicts, stable change IDs
     - **Practical Impact**: Agents work independently, less human coordination
     - **When to Use jj**: Multi-agent projects, parallel development
     - **When git is Fine**: Single agent, sequential work, existing git workflows
  4. Include capability comparison table from research.md
  5. Cross-reference to tutorial and how-tos
- **Files**: `docs/explanation/jujutsu-for-multi-agent.md`
- **Parallel?**: Yes - can be written alongside T033
- **Key message**: "jj eliminates coordination overhead in multi-agent workflows"

### Subtask T033 – Create auto-rebase-and-conflicts.md

- **Purpose**: Explain jj's auto-rebase and non-blocking conflict model (FR-013)
- **Steps**:
  1. Create `docs/explanation/auto-rebase-and-conflicts.md`
  2. Title: "Auto-Rebase and Non-Blocking Conflicts"
  3. Structure:
     - **Change-Based vs Commit-Based**: jj tracks changes, not commits
     - **How Auto-Rebase Works**: When base changes, dependent changes update
     - **Non-Blocking Conflicts**:
       - Conflicts are data, not errors
       - Stored in files with markers
       - Work continues while conflicts exist
       - Resolve when convenient
     - **Implications for Agents**:
       - Sync always succeeds
       - Never blocked by conflicts
       - Human reviews resolved state
     - **Comparison with git**: Table showing behavioral differences
  4. Consider including a diagram (mermaid) showing rebase flow
  5. Cross-reference to sync and conflict how-tos
- **Files**: `docs/explanation/auto-rebase-and-conflicts.md`
- **Parallel?**: Yes
- **Key message**: "Conflicts don't stop work; they're resolved when convenient"

### Subtask T034 – Add cross-references to all pages

- **Purpose**: Connect all new and updated documentation (FR-015)
- **Steps**:
  1. Review all new files (WP03, WP04, T032, T033)
  2. Review all updated files (WP05)
  3. Add "See Also" sections where missing
  4. Ensure bidirectional links (if A links to B, B should link to A)
  5. Verify link paths are relative and correct
  6. Cross-reference patterns:
     - Tutorial → How-tos for specific tasks
     - How-tos → Reference for command details
     - How-tos → Explanations for concepts
     - Explanations → Tutorials for hands-on learning
- **Files**: All new and updated documentation files
- **Parallel?**: No - must wait for all content complete

### Subtask T035 – Test DocFX build locally

- **Purpose**: Verify documentation builds without errors (FR-016)
- **Steps**:
  1. Run DocFX build:
     ```bash
     cd docs
     docfx docfx.json
     ```
  2. Check for:
     - Build errors (missing files, invalid YAML)
     - Warnings (broken links, missing metadata)
     - Output in `docs/_site/`
  3. If errors occur, fix and rebuild
  4. Document any issues encountered
- **Files**: `docs/docfx.json`, `docs/_site/`
- **Parallel?**: No - must wait for all content

### Subtask T036 – Verify all internal links

- **Purpose**: Ensure no 404s in documentation (FR-017, SC-005)
- **Steps**:
  1. After successful DocFX build, check links:
     ```bash
     # Option 1: Use link checker tool
     npx linkinator docs/_site --recurse

     # Option 2: Manual spot check of key pages
     ```
  2. Check specifically:
     - All new pages are accessible from toc.yml
     - All cross-references resolve
     - No broken href or src attributes
  3. Fix any broken links
  4. Document verification results
- **Files**: All documentation files
- **Parallel?**: No - must wait for DocFX build

### Subtask T037 – Verify search terms coverage

- **Purpose**: Ensure both "jj" and "jujutsu" are searchable (SC-007)
- **Steps**:
  1. Search for "jujutsu" in _site output - verify results
  2. Search for "jj" in _site output - verify results
  3. Check that key pages appear in both searches:
     - jujutsu-workflow.md
     - jujutsu-for-multi-agent.md
     - cli-commands.md (sync, ops sections)
  4. If search coverage is poor, add terms to:
     - Page titles and headers
     - First paragraph of each page
     - Metadata/frontmatter if DocFX supports it
- **Files**: All jj-related documentation
- **Parallel?**: No - must wait for DocFX build

## Risks & Mitigations

- **DocFX build fails**: Test incrementally during earlier WPs
- **Missing cross-references**: Use checklist to track all link pairs
- **Search terms not indexed**: Add both terms prominently in content

## Definition of Done Checklist

- [ ] T032: jujutsu-for-multi-agent.md created with design rationale
- [ ] T033: auto-rebase-and-conflicts.md created with conceptual explanation
