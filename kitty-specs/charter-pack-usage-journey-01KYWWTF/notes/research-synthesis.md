# Research Synthesis — Charter Pack Usage Journey (Mission 2 of 2)

Source: 2-lens research squad (architect-alphonso = architecture + reproduced journeys; paula-patterns =
related-issues + campsite), read-only against `feat/charter-pack-usage-journey` (based on the M1
`doctrine-built-in-seam-consolidation` branch). Scope: #3104 (P1), #3105 (P2), #3118 (tech-debt).

## Root cause (reproduced end-to-end)

`charter pack apply` writes the **activation write store** (`config.yaml` `activated_*`, or the pointed-at
`charter.yaml` when a `charter:` pointer exists) but nothing compiles it into the **compiled bundle**
(`.kittify/charter/charter.yaml` — the read authority). `charter.md` is a **display-only** companion
(corroborated in-tree: `freshness/computer.py:10-13`, `compact_governance.py:47-65`). Reproduced:
- empty repo → `is_charter_empty=True` → generic-agent net fires.
- `charter pack apply minimal` → config.yaml gains `activated_*`, NO bundle, NO pointer → `is_charter_empty`
  flips **False** → `resolve_generic_fallback` returns None → router runs → **ROUTER_NO_MATCH (#3104)**;
  `charter context` → "Charter file not found"; `charter status` → available:False (**#3105**).
- `charter generate --no-from-interview` (the compile, no interview) → materializes `charter.yaml` +
  seeds `charter.md` + migrates config→`charter:` pointer → context/status/freshness all correct.

## Bridge decision — OPTION (a), validated

`compile_charter`/`write_compiled_charter` (`compiler.py:325/440`) already lower config.yaml `activated_*` →
`charter.yaml` with NO interview (exposed as the CLI command `spec-kitty charter generate`). M2 does NOT
build a compiler — it wires `apply` to the existing seam and retargets the read gates. **Reject option (b)**
(read surfaces read config.yaml directly): re-creates the multi-authority smell (5+ readers re-deriving)
and can't serve pointer-migrated projects. `charter.yaml` stays the single derived read-cache;
config.yaml/pointer the single write authority.

**Shape: `apply --compile` opt-in + truthful default output.** Auto-compiling inside `apply` is too heavy
and changes its contract — `generate` hard-requires a git worktree (`generate.py:314`), seeds `charter.md`,
creates `library/`, writes `.gitignore`, git-stages, and migrates config→pointer. So default `apply` stays
a pure additive merge (git-agnostic) but its output **names the exact next command** (`spec-kitty charter
generate`; today `pack.py:200-205` hand-waves "a compile may still be needed"); `--compile` chains
`generate --no-from-interview` after the merge (inheriting the git-worktree requirement, documented).

## Read-surface retarget list (charter.md-presence → charter.yaml authority)

HARD gates to RETARGET (produce the #3105 symptoms):
- `src/charter/context.py:286` — bootstrap gate on `CHARTER_MD` → retarget to `charter.yaml` presence;
  render `charter.md` prose only when present (graceful-degrade like `_compact_section_block`).
- `src/specify_cli/cli/commands/charter/_common.py:27 _resolve_charter_path` — raises on `charter.md`
  absent; consumed by `_status_collectors.py:62`. **Add a SIBLING `_resolve_charter_bundle_path`
  (charter.yaml)** and point only the presence/"governance exists" gates at it — do NOT retarget the
  shared `_resolve_charter_path` in place (also used by `status.py`, `resynthesize.py`).

SOFT retarget: `src/charter/context_json.py:81-93 _project_charter_json_block` — report `charter.yaml`
presence as the primary signal (charter.md becomes secondary display).

DO NOT retarget (legitimately charter.md prose — the #3094/#3095 boundary): `context.py:397-399` the
`--include section:<id>` selector renders prose that only exists in `charter.md`. Keep it bound (the
compile seeds `charter.md`, so it resolves post-bridge). Already-correct, change nothing:
`freshness/computer.py`, `compact.py`, `compact_governance.py`.

## The SECOND directive authority — retire the catalog-fallback (no-legacy-resolver-paths)

`resolver.py:233-260 _resolve_directives_selection` catalog-falls-back to `sorted(doctrine_catalog.directives)`
= ALL built-ins when `governance.selected_directives` is empty (which it is after apply+compile, since
compile writes `catalog`/activation but not the `governance.selected_directives` prose). Reproduced: apply
minimal (5 directives) + compile → `resolve_project_governance().directives` returned **29** with
`directives_source='catalog_fallback'`, while the activation-aware context bundle correctly delivered 5.
**Retire the catalog-fallback; source the fallback from the config-activated set (the compiled
catalog / `PackContext` authority)** so `resolve_project_governance` stops being a second, divergent
directive authority. (This is the RED test today.) Its 5 consumers — `prompt_builder.py:437`,
`runtime/doctor.py:133`, `context_json.py:139`, `compact.py:303`, `resolver.py:415` — carry no charter.md
pre-gate; only the fallback source changes.

## The dispatch predicate (#3104) — corrected, org-pack-safe

Seam: `executor.py:326-328` `fallback_decision or self._router.route(...)`. `resolve_generic_fallback`
short-circuits before the router; `is_charter_empty` (`empty_charter.py:48-67`) decides whether the router
runs. A PURE `charter.yaml`-presence predicate is NOT #3064-safe — it would fire the net for an org-pack
project that has routable profiles WITHOUT a bundle (regression). Correct predicate splits
governance-emptiness from dispatch-routability:
```
def is_charter_empty(repo_root) -> bool:
    if (repo_root/".kittify/charter/charter.yaml").exists():
        return False                                   # compiled bundle → configured
    pc = PackContext.from_config(repo_root)
    if pc.org_roots != ():          return False        # org packs → router-routable
    if pc.activated_agent_profiles is not None: return False  # explicit profiles → routable
    return True
```
Behaviour matrix: empty→net fires; apply-no-compile→net fires (**#3104 fix**); apply+compile→net off, router
runs (NO_MATCH honest); org-pack no-compile→net off (router matches org profiles, no regression);
agent-profile activation→net off.
- **Drops the non-routing dimensions** (directives/tactics/toolguides/procedures/paradigms/styleguides/
  step-contracts/**glossary-packs**) from the net predicate — retires WS-C's P-D (no dimension-set to keep
  set-equal) and **folds #3118** (the double config-load collapses to one `stat()` + at most one
  `PackContext.from_config`, only when the bundle is absent).
- **DECISION to record:** this **intentionally reverses the glossary-pack dimension of #3064** — a
  glossary-only project with no bundle now fires the net (generic-agent). More correct (a glossary adds no
  routable profile), but a deliberate behaviour change, not a slip. "Empty" means **bundle ABSENT**, never
  "bundle present but activations empty" (a bootstrapped-empty `charter.yaml` keeps the net OFF — pin a
  test; inspecting bundle *contents* would re-import the #3064 exhaustiveness trap).

## Related issues (fold / conflict / separate)

- **#3104, #3105 — CORE M2.** **#3118 — FOLD** (dissolved by the bundle-presence predicate).
- **#3106 — SEPARATE (M1/WP05).** Activation-vocab unification + the live glossary drift fix. NOT M2.
- **#3107 — PARTIAL FOLD:** the journey-doc portion (document apply→generate + empty-charter dispatch in the
  journey guides) folds; the inert CLI-reference parity gate is separate docs-infra.
- **#3094 / #3095 — CONFLICT-ADJACENT (boundary):** `charter context --include section:terminology-canon`
  parses `charter.md` prose (`context.py:397`) — M2 must NOT retarget the section-selector prose reader,
  only the presence gate (`context.py:286`).
- **#2831 (P0) — verify post-M2** (same disjoint-store family; may close as a side-effect; don't fold).
- **#3092 / #3045 / #2992 / #2213 / #2940 / #3009 / #3052 — SEPARATE.** #3092/#3045 are pre-existing red
  baselines (classify vs merge-base, never green-wash).

## A FOURTH config→bundle producer — must converge (cross-mission)

`m_unify_charter_activation_finalize.apply()` (`m_...finalize.py:384-396`) already mints `charter.yaml` from
bare config activation when the bundle is absent AND strips `activated_*` from config.yaml — a latent
parallel lowering to M2's `apply --compile`. **M2 must assert the two converge** (same shape) or document
the migration as the upgrade-time equivalent, so the config→bundle transform is one authority, not two.

## C-004 — hard dependency on Mission 1

M2 is sequenced AFTER M1 and its branch is BASED ON the M1 branch. Two couplings:
1. **Shared file:** M1 WP02 owns `src/charter/resolver.py` (built-in-reader migration + operator-string
   repoint at :187/:250). M2's `_resolve_directives_selection` retarget edits the same file — M2 must NOT
   repoint those operator strings (M1 owns them) and must re-verify M1's resolver changes before layering.
2. **Activation-store trust:** M2's resolver-fallback-from-activated-set trusts M1/FR-010 having unified the
   activation vocabulary onto `YAML_KEY_MAP` and fixed the live `activated_glossary_packs` drift. M2 spec
   constraint: "Depends on M1 FR-010; the resolver-fallback retarget trusts the unified activation store."

## Campsite (clean WHILE M2 edits these files — no scope creep)

- `empty_charter.py`: the composite predicate + its 20-line dimension-enumeration docstring + the
  `charter_activated_urns`/`PackContext` imports become dead — delete; update `_MATCH_REASON` to the
  bundle-presence rationale so the warning panel doesn't lie.
- `pack.py`: hoist the `resolve_builtin_pack_path` resolve-or-exit try-block duplicated 4× (list/path/apply)
  if `apply` grows a compile branch.
- `context.py:286` vs `:333/:397`: introduce a distinct bundle-presence resolution; leave prose readers on
  `CHARTER_MD` — do NOT collapse both onto one path constant (whack-a-field that would break #3094/#3095).
- Do NOT re-touch `compiler.py:529-534/627-634` duplicated constants (M1/WP05 debt) or the resolver
  operator strings (M1/WS-A).

## Journey acceptance tests (8)

1. #3104 apply-no-compile keeps the net (generic-agent, NOT ROUTER_NO_MATCH).
2. #3104 apply+compile disengages the net (router runs; NO_MATCH honest).
3. #3104 org-pack composite-safety regression guard (org pack, no bundle → net stays off).
4. #3105 context — bundle authority (renders the 5 activated directives; delete `charter.md` → still renders).
5. #3105 status — SYNCED on `charter.yaml` authority (survives `charter.md` deletion).
6. Resolver single-authority — `resolve_project_governance().directives` returns the 5 activated, not 29
   catalog-fallback (RED today).
7. Truthful output — default `apply` names `spec-kitty charter generate`; `--compile` states it compiled.
8. #3118 perf (advisory) — `is_charter_empty` on an unconfigured repo does ≤1 `PackContext.from_config` + 1
   `stat`, no URN load.

## OPERATOR FOLD (2026-08-01) — #3095, #3096, #3102 pulled into M2 scope

Per operator direction, three adjacent charter/doctrine tooling & CI items are folded into this mission
(now FR-010/011/012, User Story 4, SC-007). This **revises** two verdicts in the related-issues table above:

- **#3095 (+ its twin #3094) — was "CONFLICT-ADJACENT boundary", now IN SCOPE (FR-010).** The advertised
  section selectors `section:terminology-canon` / `section:code-review-checklist` (which generated prompts
  and action-context *require*) fail with "No charter section found for selector". M2 now owns making them
  resolve to the corresponding compiled section — OR stopping the doctrine templates/surface from
  advertising a selector the CLI cannot resolve. IMPORTANT: this fix stays on the `charter.md`/section
  *prose* path (`context.py:397`); it is a SEPARATE change from FR-005's presence-gate retarget, and does
  NOT collapse the prose reader onto `charter.yaml` (C-003 still holds — the two changes touch two paths).
  Plan-phase investigation: determine whether these sections should be produced by the charter compile
  (provide them) or the selectors are stale in the mission-step prompts (stop advertising) — likely the
  former for terminology-canon (maps to the glossary/terminology surface).
- **#3096 — new fold (FR-011).** Documented `spec-kitty analyze` command is absent; only `agent mission
  record-analysis` works. Missing-CLI-command-is-a-gap: expose a thin alias OR redirect the skill/mapping/
  docs to the supported command. Small, self-contained CLI-surface fix.
- **#3102 — was "SEPARATE (deferred, gated on seam work + #3101)", now IN SCOPE (FR-012).** Path-filtered
  CI workflow for `src/doctrine/**` + `src/charter/**`. Its seam-work prerequisite is satisfied once M1
  lands (M2 is based on M1); it does NOT require #3101 (wheel-split). New surface: `.github/workflows/`.

These do not change the core bridge/predicate/resolver design; they are additive. The C-001 (M1
precondition) and C-002 (shared resolver.py) constraints are unaffected.

## REVISION-SQUAD REFRESH (2026-08-01) — vs LANDED main (M1 merged)

Mission 1 **landed on main** (`873832aa1` seam consolidation + full `packs/built-in` relocation;
`fd53023b6` = M1/FR-010 activation-vocab unification + `restore activated_glossary_packs`; #3116
context.py shim removal). This mission is rebased onto that main. A 2-agent revision squad
(reviewer-renata = ref/consistency; architect-alphonso = design re-validation + live repro) refreshed
the spec against the post-M1 tree.

**Design VERDICT: holds in full.** architect-alphonso reproduced all three root causes live on the
current tree: empty→net fires; `apply minimal`→`is_charter_empty=False` with no bundle (#3104);
`resolve_project_governance()`→`catalog_fallback` = **29** while the config-activated set = **5**
(FR-007); and `PackContext.activated_directives` reads exactly 5 (M1's unified vocab feeds M2's fix).
The compile bridge, `apply --compile` opt-in, read-surface retarget, sibling-path discipline,
org-pack-safe predicate, and the 8 acceptance tests all stand.

**File:line re-anchors (M1 shifted context.py via #3116 shim removal; prefer SYMBOLS — this file has
drifted twice):**
- `context.py` presence gate `:286 → :206/:233/:236` (symbol: `build_charter_context` `CHARTER_MD` gate);
  prose body read `:333 → :280`; section-selector `:397 → :309/:344/:354` (symbol:
  `build_charter_context_include` `kind=="section"` branch).
- executor auto-route `:326-328 → :326/:328`; compiler `:325/:440 → :326/:441`; generate git-worktree
  `:314 → :313`; finalize migration `:384-396 → :391/:415`; context_json `:81-93 → :83-98`.
- EXACT (unchanged): `empty_charter.is_charter_empty:48-67`; `resolver._resolve_directives_selection:233`
  + `catalog_fallback:258-260`; `_common._resolve_charter_path:27`; `_status_collectors:62`;
  `pack.py apply:200-205`; the 5 `resolve_project_governance` consumers.

**Structural DEEPENINGS to fold (both agents):**
1. **FR-007 root:** the activation-aware `DoctrineService` wrapper (`resolver.py:57-139`) filters
   paradigms/procedures/agent_profiles by `PackContext` but has **NO `directives` property** — so
   directives alone fall through to the unfiltered catalog-fallback. FR-007 = the missing directives
   filter: thread `PackContext.from_config(repo_root).activated_directives` into
   `resolve_project_governance` (`:289`; builds the unfiltered catalog at `:316`, constructs no
   `PackContext` today) and scope the `:258` fallback by it.
2. **FR-005 `_status_collectors` nuance:** `:62` calls `_resolve_charter_path` (raises on `charter.md`
   absent) *before* its own `charter.yaml`-aware logic (`:65-76`) runs — so that awareness is DEAD when
   `charter.md` is absent. Confirms the sibling-`_resolve_charter_bundle_path` design (do NOT retarget
   the shared helper in place).
3. **FR-010 true target:** the selector engine is `section_bodies.py::render_critical_section_include`
   (`:282`; slugifies `ACTION_CRITICAL_SECTIONS` incl. `"Terminology Canon"`/`"Code Review Checklist"`),
   reached via `build_charter_context_include` — NOT `context.py:397`. The dead-end is a **content**
   question (does the compiled charter contain those headings), not a resolver gap.
4. **FR-008 narrows:** the activation-key *vocabulary* is already one authority (M1's `ACTIVATION_YAML_KEYS`,
   which the finalize migration already derives from) — M2 asserts the **transform shape** only.

**Constraints reframed:** C-001 (M1 precondition) → LANDED (`873832aa1`/`fd53023b6`); C-002 → M1 already
repointed `resolver.py:187/:250` (distinct from M2's `:258-260`); C-004 (apply --compile opt-in) unchanged
— it was never an M1 precondition (task grouping error).

**Folded/core issues re-validated — all still OPEN + valid on main:** #3104/#3105/#3118, #3095/#3094,
#3096 (no `analyze` subcommand; only `agent mission record-analysis`), #3102 (no path-filtered
`src/doctrine/**`+`src/charter/**` workflow; only plugin-validate/ci-quality/release). The only main
advance beyond M1 is #3129 landing folds — **docs-only**, no code overlap with M2's surface.

## POST-PLAN SQUAD REFRESH (2026-08-02) — 3-lens adversarial review of the IC map

After /plan authored the IC-01..IC-09 map, a 3-profile squad (architect-alphonso = architecture/HOLDS-WITH-FIXES;
paula-patterns = brownfield/CLEAN-WITH-NOTES; planner-priti = decomposition/DECOMPOSABLE-WITH-FIXES) reviewed it
read-only against the live tree. Verdict: **design HOLDS**, folded these corrections into spec.md + plan.md:

**MAJOR (would ship green-but-wrong):**
- **FR-007 fix-locus corrected (alphonso M2):** the fix is `resolver.py::_resolve_directives_selection`/
  `resolve_project_governance` (thread `PackContext.activated_directives` as the fallback source at `:258`),
  NOT the `DoctrineService` wrapper. All 5 consumers call `resolve_project_governance` directly and never
  traverse the wrapper — a wrapper `directives` property would leave journey-6 RED. The earlier "structural
  root = wrapper" claim conflated the context-bundle path (returns 5, uses wrapper) with the 29-path.
- **FR-007 three-state guard (alphonso M3):** `activated_directives` is `None|frozenset()|{ids}`; filter ONLY
  when `is not None`, else keep catalog default — a naive `sorted(activated or frozenset())` regresses a bare
  project 29→0. Added a bare-project regression test to NFR-002.
- **empty_charter.py re-anchored (alphonso M1 + paula M-3):** real path `src/specify_cli/invocation/
  empty_charter.py` (NOT `src/charter/`). `PackContext` stays LIVE (only `charter_activated_urns` dead).
  Consequence: it is OUTSIDE IC-08's `src/charter/**`+`src/doctrine/**` filter → IC-08 must widen `paths:` to
  include `src/specify_cli/invocation/` or accept main-CI-only (false-green risk for the P1 fix).
- **#2552 folded (paula M-1):** the code-review-checklist twin of #3094 — OPEN, closes for free under FR-010.
- **FR-006 second site + contract flip (paula M-2):** 2nd present-signal site at `cli/commands/charter/
  context.py:158` (fallback default); flipping `project_charter.present` is a `charter context --json`
  contract change — recorded (NFR-004), cross-ref #2787.
- **context.py dual-ownership resolved (priti M1):** IC-06's real dead-end raise is `context.py:354`; confine
  IC-06 to `section_bodies.py` (return placeholder, never None) so `context.py` stays IC-03's exclusive file.

**MINOR:** pack.py hoist is 2 sites not 4, `list_cmd` differs (paula m-4); library gates reuse
`bundle.CHARTER_YAML:48`, layer rule forbids `src/charter`→`specify_cli` import (paula m-5); IC-05 expects
document-as-equivalent not byte-equality, undersized→fold into IC-02 (paula m-6/priti m1); seed-stub tensions
#2808→prefer graceful-degrade only (paula m-7); IC-07 scope-guard vs #849/#851/#853 (paula m-8); frozenset()
opt-out pin (alphonso m6); NFR-004 enumerate ALL dropped dimensions (alphonso m5); context_json.py IC-03-owned/
IC-04 read-only (priti m2); IC-03 near size ceiling→split-ready (priti m5).

**HELD (verified live, no change):** compile-seam bridge reuse + C-004 git-agnostic default apply; C-003
two-path split (forced by the `src/charter`→`specify_cli` layer rule, not just discipline); FR-005 load-bearing
`_status_collectors:62`-raises-first claim; empty=bundle-absent #3064-safety; C-002 M1 strings distinct;
FR-011 redirect; the 2-producer convergence set (no 5th producer).
