# Specification Quality Checklist: Constitution Packaging Safety and Redesign

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS ✅

- Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- No mention of specific programming languages or frameworks in requirements
- User scenarios written from user/business perspective
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) completed

### Requirement Completeness - PASS ✅

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All 27 functional requirements are testable (FR-001 through FR-027)
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (verify with commands, Content-Length > 0, completes without errors)
- Success criteria avoid implementation (e.g., "Dashboard serves HTML content" not "asyncio event loop works")
- Acceptance scenarios cover all four user stories with Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases identify boundary conditions (customized constitution during upgrade, killed processes, repeated runs)
- Scope bounded to four specific goals with clear boundaries
- Dependencies identified (pyproject.toml changes, template manager updates, migration system)

### Feature Readiness - PASS ✅

- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenario in user stories
- User scenarios prioritized (P1: Safe dogfooding & Optional constitution, P2: Windows dashboard & Smooth upgrades)
- Each story independently testable with specific verification steps
- Success criteria measurable (zero filled-in files, 100% commands work, completes in X minutes)
- No implementation leakage (avoids mentioning Python, asyncio, specific file structures beyond what's necessary)

## Notes

All checklist items pass. Specification is ready for `/spec-kitty.clarify` or `/spec-kitty.plan`.

The specification successfully captures all four goals:
1. **Packaging safety** (FR-001 through FR-006) - Clear separation of templates vs runtime artifacts
2. **Optional constitution** (FR-007 through FR-016) - Interactive discovery with minimal/comprehensive modes
3. **Windows dashboard fix** (FR-017 through FR-020) - Platform-appropriate signal handling
4. **Upgrade migrations** (FR-021 through FR-027) - Graceful handling of missing dependencies

All requirements are testable, measurable, and technology-agnostic at the appropriate abstraction level.
