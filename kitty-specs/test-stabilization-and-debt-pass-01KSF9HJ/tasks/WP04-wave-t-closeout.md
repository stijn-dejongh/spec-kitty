## ⚡ Do This First: Load Agent Profile

Invoke `/ad-hoc-profile-load` with argument `reviewer-renata` before reading further. This WP verifies NFR-001 ceiling and files follow-up issues — pure quality / acceptance work, no production code changes.

## Objective

After WP02 and WP03 have landed, verify the mission has met its NFR-001 ceiling (post-mission failure count ≤ 75). For every cluster from WP01's `triage.md` that was resolved as `defer-to-sub-issue`, file the actual GitHub issue. Update #1298 with a final delta comment summarising what landed and what was deferred.

## Branch strategy

- Planning base branch: mission lane branch
- Merge target branch: `main`
- Execution: lane workspace allocated by `finalize-tasks`.

## Context

- [`triage.md`](../triage.md) — the source of truth for which clusters are fix-here vs defer.
- [`spec.md`](../spec.md) FR-005 + NFR-001 + C-005, C-006.
- Mission #122's #1298 triage comment as the template: https://github.com/Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty/issues/1298#issuecomment-4531958466

## Subtask details

### T010 — Capture post-fix failure count

```bash
PWHEADLESS=1 .venv/bin/pytest tests/ -q --tb=no --no-summary -r f --junitxml=/tmp/01KSF9HJ-post-fix.xml 2>&1 | tail -5
```

Compare to `/tmp/01KSF9HJ-baseline.xml` from WP01. The delta MUST be at least 70% reduction (242 → ≤73) per NFR-001 (target ≤ 75).

### T011 — File follow-up sub-issues

For each cluster in `triage.md`'s Resolution matrix marked `defer-to-sub-issue: #1298X`, create the actual issue:

```bash
unset GITHUB_TOKEN
gh issue create \
  --repo Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty \
  --title "Test failures: <cluster name> (#1298 follow-up)" \
  --body "$(cat <<EOF
Filed from mission 01KSF9HJ per FR-005.

## Cluster
<copy from triage.md>

## Hypothesised root cause
<copy from triage.md>

## Affected tests
<list from triage.md>

## Reproduction
\`\`\`bash
PWHEADLESS=1 .venv/bin/pytest <test-files> -q
\`\`\`

## Parent issue
- #1298
EOF
)"
```

Record each created issue number; add a reference back to `triage.md`'s Resolution matrix.

### T012 — Verify NFR-001 ceiling

Assert that the post-fix failure count is ≤ 75. If it's not, raise a blocker — the mission can't close.

If `pytest tests/ -q` shows > 75 failures, analyse the delta:
- Are the extra failures inside scope but introduced by WP02/WP03's changes? → ROLLBACK or refine.
- Are they outside scope (new flake, infra drift)? → Document and continue, then file a new triage round.

### T013 — Update #1298 with final delta comment

```bash
gh issue comment 1298 --repo Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Mission 01KSF9HJ closeout — final delta

Starting baseline (this mission's WP01): <N> failures.
Post-mission failure count: <M> failures.
Reduction: <(N-M)/N * 100>% (target was ≥70% per FR-005).

Closed in this mission:
- <list each fix-here cluster + WP that closed it>

Deferred to follow-up sub-issues:
- <#1298a — title>
- <#1298b — title>
- ...

`triage.md` archived at `kitty-specs/test-stabilization-and-debt-pass-01KSF9HJ/triage.md`.
EOF
)"
```

Also author `kitty-specs/test-stabilization-and-debt-pass-01KSF9HJ/triage-closeout.md` mirroring this comment so the mission's own record persists.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] `/tmp/01KSF9HJ-post-fix.xml` captured.
- [ ] Failure count ≤ 75 (NFR-001).
- [ ] Sub-issues filed for every `defer` row in `triage.md`.
- [ ] `triage.md` updated with sub-issue numbers next to each deferred cluster.
- [ ] `triage-closeout.md` exists with the final-delta summary.
- [ ] #1298 commented with the closeout summary.

## Risks

- **NFR-001 ceiling miss**: if the post-fix count is >75, this WP cannot close. Either WP02/WP03 must absorb more failures (which expands scope past NFR-004) or the mission accepts the ceiling miss with HiC sign-off.
- **Stale baseline**: if upstream/main advanced since WP01, the baseline number may have shifted. Use WP01's captured number as the reference, not a fresh re-run.

## Reviewer guidance

1. Verify the post-fix count actually meets NFR-001 — don't rubber-stamp a "close enough" 76-failure outcome.
2. Spot-check 2-3 sub-issues for non-trivial root-cause hypotheses (C-006 — "Failure too broad — defer" is not acceptable).
3. Confirm #1298 comment cross-references both `triage.md` and `triage-closeout.md`.
