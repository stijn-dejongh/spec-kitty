# Tasks — Test Stabilization & Architectural Debt Pass

**Mission**: `test-stabilization-and-debt-pass-01KSF9HJ`
**Mission ID**: `01KSF9HJBFKRBC617JVHKZXNE2`
**Planning base branch**: `kitty/mission-test-stabilization-and-debt-pass-01KSF9HJ`
**Merge target branch**: `main`
**Total WPs**: 11 (WP11 is the stretch from FR-008; numbered out-of-sequence to flag its stretch status. Counts against the NFR-004 ≤10 cap by 1 — accepted because LD-2 is mechanical test-only work)
**Total subtasks**: 41

---

## Parallelisation highlights

- **Wave T**: WP02, WP03 are independent after WP01 lands triage.md. WP04 is the closeout gate.
- **Wave A**: WP05 (doctrine) is independent of WP06/WP07/WP08 (charter package surface). WP11 is independent of WP05-08. WP06 → WP07 → WP08 MUST sequence.
- **Wave Q**: WP09 and WP10 fully independent.
- **Cross-wave**: Wave T must complete before Wave A and Wave Q because Wave T's test-fix work establishes the baseline against which architectural-refactor regressions can be measured (NFR-002). Wave A and Wave Q can run in parallel with each other.

## MVP scope recommendation

If the mission needs to ship something before all 10 WPs land, the MVP is **Wave T (WP01-04)** — that closes #1298 sufficient enough to mark NFR-001 met. Wave A and Wave Q are deliberately bounded "while we're in here" debt repayment; they can ship in a follow-up if release pressure mounts.
