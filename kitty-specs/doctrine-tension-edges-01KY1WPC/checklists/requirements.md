# Specification Quality Checklist: Doctrine Tension as First-Class DRG Edges

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) — the Change Surface Map names doctrine schema/model files as the *product* of the mission, not incidental tech choices; kept at requirement level
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders (operator/pack-author framing in user stories)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [~] Three deliberate [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (D1 downstream-compat, D2 anti-pattern-node-kind, D3 tension-under-all-active) — escalated to the operator by the post-spec squad; each carries a decision_id and is tracked via the decision protocol
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Requirement types are separated (Functional / Non-Functional / Constraints)
- [x] IDs are unique across FR-###, NFR-###, and C-### entries
- [x] All requirement rows include a non-empty Status value
- [x] Non-functional requirements include measurable thresholds (grep-zero, ≤2 findings, coherent=true, 0 drift)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (outcome-framed; counts/coherence, not framework internals)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified (symmetric drift, non-transitivity, half-reconciled, unmarked reject target, cascade, partial migration)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (out-of-scope: #2829, #2827)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (ADR 2026-07-21-1, extractor retirement 2026-07-18-1, replaces canonical)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (flag → resolve → migrate → de-noise → parity)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification beyond the deliberate Change Surface Map

## Notes

- The Change Surface Map is intentional: this is a doctrine-infrastructure mission where the schema/model changes and their propagation across read/write/checkup surfaces ARE the deliverable and the acceptance backbone (per operator instruction).
- Refined 2026-07-21 after a 4-lens adversarial/enhancement squad. Non-decision findings remediated: fakeable gates tightened (NFR-003 exact set, NFR-001 must-fire), anti-pattern marker home corrected to `DRGNode`, glossary parity scoped + comparator made a deliverable (A2), migration order pinned (C-006), bulk-edit flagged (C-007), test-blast-radius + freshness canary + cascade-exclusion test added to the checkup surface, correctness invariants promoted to acceptance (INV-001..005), grep scope reconciled (NFR-002/SC-004).
- Three decisions escalated to the operator (D1/D2/D3) — spec is committed WITH markers pending those answers; not a quality-bar failure.
