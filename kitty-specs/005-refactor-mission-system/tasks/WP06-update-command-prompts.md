# Work Package Prompt: WP06 – Update Command Prompts

## Objectives & Success Criteria

**Goal**: Remove duplicated "Location Pre-flight Check" sections from 8 command prompt files, replace with calls to shared Python validation from WP01 guards module.

**Success Criteria**:
- All 8 command prompts updated (software-dev: plan/implement/review/merge, research: plan/implement/review/merge)
- Pre-flight check sections replaced with Python validation calls
- 60+ lines of duplicate bash code eliminated
- Commands fail fast with standardized error messages
- Research commands enhanced with citation tracking guidance
- Validation behavior identical to previous inline bash checks
- All 8 subtasks (T041-T048) completed

## Context & Constraints

**Problem Statement**: Every command duplicates ~20 lines of location validation:

**Current State** (duplicated in 8 files):
```markdown
## Location Pre-flight Check (CRITICAL for AI Agents)

Before proceeding with planning, verify you are in the correct working directory:

**Check your current branch:**
```bash
git branch --show-current
```

**Expected output:** A feature branch like `001-feature-name`
**If you see `main`:** You are in the wrong location!

**This command MUST run from a feature worktree, not the main repository.**

If you're on the `main` branch:
1. Check for available worktrees: `ls .worktrees/`
2. Navigate to the appropriate feature worktree: `cd .worktrees/<feature-name>`
3. Verify you're in the right place: `git branch --show-current` should show the feature branch
4. Then re-run this command

The script will fail if you're not in a feature worktree.
```

**Desired State** (DRY - single source):
```markdown
## Location Pre-flight Check (CRITICAL for AI Agents)

Run pre-flight validation to ensure you're in the correct feature worktree:

```python
from specify_cli.guards import validate_worktree_location

result = validate_worktree_location()
if not result.is_valid:
    print(result.format_error())
    exit(1)
```

This validates you're on a feature branch in a worktree, not on main.
```

**Supporting Documents**:
- Spec: `kitty-specs/005-refactor-mission-system/spec.md` (User Story 1, FR-002)
- WP01 Prompt: `tasks/planned/phase-1-foundation/WP01-guards-module-preflight-validation.md`
- Existing Prompts: `.kittify/missions/*/commands/*.md`

**Critical Dependency**: **This WP MUST wait for WP01 to complete.** Guards module must exist and be tested before updating command prompts.

**Files to Update** (all in `.kittify/missions/`):
1. `software-dev/commands/plan.md`
2. `software-dev/commands/implement.md`
3. `software-dev/commands/review.md`
4. `software-dev/commands/merge.md`
5. `research/commands/plan.md`
6. `research/commands/implement.md`
7. `research/commands/review.md`
8. `research/commands/merge.md`

## Subtasks & Detailed Guidance

### Subtask T041 – Update software-dev plan.md

**Purpose**: Replace inline pre-flight check with Python validation call.

**Steps**:
1. Open file: `.kittify/missions/software-dev/commands/plan.md`
2. Locate "Location Pre-flight Check" section (around line 19-39)
3. Replace with:
   ```markdown
   ## Location Pre-flight Check (CRITICAL for AI Agents)

   Before proceeding with planning, verify you are in the correct working directory by running the shared pre-flight validation:

   ```python
   from specify_cli.guards import validate_worktree_location

   # Validate location
   result = validate_worktree_location()
   if not result.is_valid:
       print(result.format_error())
       print("\nThis command MUST run from a feature worktree, not the main repository.")
       exit(1)
   ```

   **What this validates**:
- Current branch is a feature branch (pattern: `###-feature-name`)
- Not running from `main` branch
- Provides navigation instructions if validation fails

   **Path reference rule:** When you mention directories or files, provide either the absolute path or a path relative to the project root (for example, `kitty-specs/<feature>/tasks/`). Never refer to a folder by name alone.
   ```

4. Save file
5. Test by running `/spec-kitty.plan` from main branch (should fail with guards.py error)
6. Test from feature worktree (should pass validation)

**Files**: `.kittify/missions/software-dev/commands/plan.md`

**Parallel?**: Yes (each command file can be updated independently)

**Notes**: Preserve "Path reference rule" section. Only replace pre-flight check logic.

---

### Subtask T042 – Update software-dev implement.md

**Purpose**: Replace inline pre-flight check in implement command.

**Steps**:
1. Open file: `.kittify/missions/software-dev/commands/implement.md`
2. Locate "Location Pre-flight Check" section (around line 18-41)
3. Replace with same Python validation block as T041
4. Preserve other sections:
   - "Review Feedback Check" (lines 43-59)
   - "Outline" section
   - Task workflow steps
5. Test by running `/spec-kitty.implement` from wrong location

**Files**: `.kittify/missions/software-dev/commands/implement.md`

**Parallel?**: Yes

**Notes**: Implement.md is longer, has additional validation sections. Only replace location check.

---

### Subtask T043 – Update software-dev review.md

**Purpose**: Replace inline pre-flight check in review command.

**Steps**:
1. Open file: `.kittify/missions/software-dev/commands/review.md`
2. Locate "Location Pre-flight Check" section
3. Replace with Python validation block
4. Preserve review-specific logic (feedback sections, approval workflow)
5. Test: Run `/spec-kitty.review` from wrong location

**Files**: `.kittify/missions/software-dev/commands/review.md`

**Parallel?**: Yes

**Notes**: Review command has complex workflow - only touch pre-flight section.

---

### Subtask T044 – Update software-dev merge.md

**Purpose**: Replace inline pre-flight check in merge command.

**Steps**:
1. Open file: `.kittify/missions/software-dev/commands/merge.md`
2. Locate "Location Pre-flight Check" section
3. Replace with Python validation block
4. Preserve merge workflow logic (git operations, cleanup)
5. Test: Run `/spec-kitty.merge` from wrong location

**Files**: `.kittify/missions/software-dev/commands/merge.md`

**Parallel?**: Yes

**Notes**: Merge is critical operation - test thoroughly after changes.

---

### Subtask T045 – Update research plan.md

**Purpose**: Update research mission plan command with Python validation.

**Steps**:
1. Open file: `.kittify/missions/research/commands/plan.md`
2. Replace "Location Pre-flight Check" section with Python validation
3. Ensure methodology-specific sections preserved
4. Verify research-specific guidance intact
5. Test: Initialize research project, run `/spec-kitty.plan`

**Files**: `.kittify/missions/research/commands/plan.md`

**Parallel?**: Yes

**Notes**: First research command update - sets pattern for T046-T048.

---

### Subtask T046 – Update research implement.md with citation guidance

**Purpose**: Update research implement command with validation AND citation tracking guidance.

**Steps**:
1. Open file: `.kittify/missions/research/commands/implement.md`
2. Replace "Location Pre-flight Check" with Python validation
3. ADD new section after pre-flight: "Citation Tracking Requirements":
   ```markdown
   ## Citation Tracking Requirements (Research Mission)

   As you conduct research and gather evidence, you MUST maintain proper citation tracking:

   ### Evidence Log Maintenance

   **File**: `research/evidence-log.csv`

   **For each source you review**:
   1. Read the source and extract key findings
   2. Add a row to evidence-log.csv with:
      - timestamp: Current time in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS)
      - source_type: journal | conference | book | web | preprint
      - citation: Full citation in BibTeX or APA format
      - key_finding: 1-2 sentence summary of main takeaway
      - confidence: high | medium | low (based on source quality)
      - notes: Additional context, caveats, or limitations

   **Citation Format Examples**:
   - BibTeX: `@article{smith2024,author={Smith et al.},title={Paper Title},journal={Journal},year={2024}}`
   - APA: `Smith, J., & Lee, K. (2024). Paper title. Journal Name, 10(2), 123-145.`
   - Simple: `Smith (2024). Paper title. Journal Name. https://doi.org/...`

   ### Source Registry Maintenance

   **File**: `research/source-register.csv`

   **When you discover a new source**:
   1. Add to source-register.csv immediately
   2. Assign unique source_id (e.g., "smith2024")
   3. Include full citation and URL
   4. Mark status as "pending"
   5. Update status to "reviewed" after reading
   6. Assign relevance rating (high/medium/low)

   **Validation**: Citations will be validated during `/spec-kitty.review`. Errors block review, warnings are advisory.
   ```

4. Save and test

**Files**: `.kittify/missions/research/commands/implement.md`

**Parallel?**: Yes

**Notes**: This makes CSV tracking actionable - agents know exactly what to do.

### Subtask T047 – Update research review.md with citation validation

**Purpose**: Add citation validation to research review workflow.

**Steps**:
1. Open file: `.kittify/missions/research/commands/review.md`
2. Replace pre-flight check with Python validation
3. Ensure citation validation section from T040 is present:
   ```markdown
   ## Citation Validation (Research Mission)

   Before proceeding with code review, validate research citations:

   ```python
   from specify_cli.validators.research import validate_citations, validate_source_register

   # Validate evidence log
   evidence_log = FEATURE_DIR / "research" / "evidence-log.csv"
   result = validate_citations(evidence_log)

   if result.has_errors:
       print(result.format_report())
       print("\n[red]ERROR:[/red] Citation validation failed.")
       print("Fix errors in evidence-log.csv before proceeding.")
       exit(1)

   if result.warning_count > 0:
       print(result.format_report())
       print("\n[yellow]Warnings found.[/yellow] Consider improving citation quality.")

   # Validate source register
   source_register = FEATURE_DIR / "research" / "source-register.csv"
   result = validate_source_register(source_register)

   if result.has_errors:
       print(result.format_report())
       print("\n[red]ERROR:[/red] Source register validation failed.")
       exit(1)
   ```

   **What gets validated**:
   - All citations non-empty
   - source_type values valid
   - confidence levels valid
   - source_id uniqueness
   - Citation format recognized (warning if not)

   **Action if validation fails**:
   - Return task to implementer with specific citation issues
   - Do not proceed with review until fixed
   ```

4. Test: Create research feature with invalid citations, run review, verify blocked

**Files**: `.kittify/missions/research/commands/review.md`

**Parallel?**: Yes

**Notes**: Critical integration point - validation must actually block review if errors exist.

---

### Subtask T048 – Update research merge.md

**Purpose**: Update research merge command with Python validation.

**Steps**:
1. Open file: `.kittify/missions/research/commands/merge.md`
2. Replace pre-flight check with Python validation
3. Ensure merge workflow preserved (git operations, worktree cleanup)
4. Add final citation validation check before merge (optional safety check):
   ```markdown
   ## Final Research Integrity Check

   Before merging research to main, perform final validation:

   ```bash
   # Quick citation validation
   python -c "
   from pathlib import Path
   from specify_cli.validators.research import validate_citations, validate_source_register

   feature_dir = Path('kitty-specs/$FEATURE_SLUG')
   evidence = feature_dir / 'research' / 'evidence-log.csv'
   sources = feature_dir / 'research' / 'source-register.csv'

   if evidence.exists():
       result = validate_citations(evidence)
       if result.has_errors:
           print('ERROR: Evidence log has citation errors')
           exit(1)

   if sources.exists():
       result = validate_source_register(sources)
       if result.has_errors:
           print('ERROR: Source register has errors')
           exit(1)

   print('✓ Citations validated')
   "
   ```
   ```

5. Test merge workflow end-to-end

**Files**: `.kittify/missions/research/commands/merge.md`

**Parallel?**: Yes

**Notes**: Final safety check before research merged to main. Prevents incomplete bibliography.

## Test Strategy

**Validation Testing Approach**:

1. **Pre-Change Baseline**:
   - Document current behavior (run commands from main/feature, capture errors)
   - Screenshot or save error messages
   - This is the baseline to match

2. **Update Each File**:
   - Replace pre-flight section
   - Test from main branch → should fail with guards.py error
   - Test from feature worktree → should pass
   - Compare error message to baseline → should be equivalent or better

3. **Regression Testing**:
   ```bash
   # For each command (plan, implement, review, merge):

   # Test from main (should fail)
   cd /path/to/spec-kitty  # Main repo
   git branch --show-current  # Verify: main
   /spec-kitty.plan  # Should fail with guards error

   # Test from worktree (should pass)
   cd .worktrees/005-refactor-mission-system
   git branch --show-current  # Verify: 005-refactor-mission-system
   /spec-kitty.plan  # Should proceed past pre-flight check
   ```

4. **Research-Specific Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Test research mission commands with CSVs
   spec-kitty init test-research --mission research
   cd test-research

   # Create feature
   /spec-kitty.specify "test research"
   cd .worktrees/###-test-research

   # Create CSVs with test data
   echo "timestamp,source_type,citation,key_finding,confidence,notes" > research/evidence-log.csv
   echo "2025-01-15T10:00:00,journal,\"Smith (2024). Title.\",Finding,high," >> research/evidence-log.csv

   # Test implement command (should show citation guidance)
   /spec-kitty.implement

   # Test review command (should validate citations)
   /spec-kitty.review
   ```

**Test Matrix**:

| Command | Mission | Test Location | Expected Result |
|---------|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| plan | software-dev | main | Fail (guards error) |
| plan | software-dev | worktree | Pass |
| implement | software-dev | main | Fail (guards error) |
| implement | research | worktree | Pass + show CSV guidance |
| review | research | worktree | Pass + validate citations |
| merge | software-dev | worktree | Pass |

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1**: Guards module has bugs, breaks all commands
- **Mitigation**: WP01 must be thoroughly tested (100% coverage) before starting this WP

**Risk 2**: Prompt updates break command execution flow
- **Mitigation**: Test each command end-to-end after update, compare to baseline

**Risk 3**: Error messages confuse users (different from previous)
- **Mitigation**: Guards.py error messages designed to match existing guidance

**Risk 4**: Python validation slower than bash
- **Mitigation**: Guards.py is lightweight (<200ms target), acceptable overhead

**Risk 5**: Research citation guidance overwhelming
- **Mitigation**: Keep guidance concise, focus on essentials, link to examples
