# Contract — Stale-Lane Auto-Rebase Classifier Policy (ADR Draft)

**Mission**: `quality-devex-hardening-3-2-01KRJGKH`
**Requirement**: FR-006 (#771)
**Constraint**: C-007 — ADR MUST land and be linked from the WP before implementation begins
**Module**: `src/specify_cli/merge/conflict_classifier.py` (new), `src/specify_cli/lanes/auto_rebase.py` (new)
**Promotion path**: This draft is promoted to `architecture/2.x/adr/2026-05-14-1-stale-lane-auto-rebase-classifier-policy.md` once the operator accepts the rules. Initial status: **PROPOSED**.

## Context

`spec-kitty merge` currently fail-stops on stale lanes — i.e. when a lane branch has not incorporated changes from the mission branch that conflict with files the lane also touched. Pre-mission analysis (`work/findings/771-auto-rebase-stale-lanes.md`) documented a 30-minute rote-merge cost per 10-WP mission, all of which is on additive-only conflict shapes that a machine can resolve safely.

The user-facing risk of attempting to auto-merge is that a wrongly-classified semantic conflict silently combines incompatible code. The classifier MUST default to **fail-safe**: when no rule matches, halt and surface the conflict to the operator.

## Decision

Adopt a **closed-list rule classifier** plus a fail-safe default. Each rule is keyed on:

1. **File pattern** (glob or specific path).
2. **Conflict shape** (what the conflict markers contain).
3. **Resolution** (the merged output the auto-rebase orchestrator writes back, plus an audit-log rule ID).

Any file or conflict shape not matching an explicit rule resolves to `Manual` and halts.

## Rules (initial set)

### R-PYPROJECT-DEPS-UNION

**File pattern**: `pyproject.toml` (top of repo).
**Conflict scope**: `[project.dependencies]` array entries, `[project.optional-dependencies.*]` arrays, `[dependency-groups.*]` arrays.
**Conflict shape**: Both sides added distinct entries (by package name) to the same array; no shared entry was modified.
**Resolution**: `Auto` — union of entries, deduplicated by package name (case-insensitive), preserving the canonical TOML formatting (one entry per line, alphabetically sorted if the existing file is sorted; otherwise preserve insertion order — match the surrounding file's pattern).
**Counter-example**: If both sides modified the version specifier on the same package (e.g. one side `httpx >=0.27`, the other `httpx >=0.28`), resolve to `Manual` — version conflicts are semantic.

### R-INIT-IMPORTS-UNION

**File pattern**: `**/__init__.py` (any package init).
**Conflict scope**: The block of `from X import Y` / `import X` statements at the top of the file.
**Conflict shape**: Both sides added distinct import lines (different `X` or different `Y`); no shared import was modified.
**Resolution**: `Auto` — union of import lines, sorted by `ruff` after the union. The auto-rebase orchestrator runs `ruff --fix --select I001 <file>` after writing the merged content, treating any non-zero exit from ruff as a fallback to `Manual`.
**Counter-example**: If one side renamed an existing import target (e.g. `from .auth import AuthFlow` → `from .auth import OAuthFlow`), the rule does not match (it's a modify, not an add) — resolve to `Manual`.

### R-URLS-LIST-UNION

**File pattern**: `**/urls.py` (Django-style) or any file whose conflicting region is bounded by a recognizable list constant (`_URLS = [`, `URL_PATTERNS = [`, etc.).
**Conflict scope**: Entries inside the list constant.
**Conflict shape**: Both sides added distinct entries; no shared entry was modified.
**Resolution**: `Auto` — union of entries, preserving the file's original ordering convention (alphabetical if sorted, insertion order otherwise).
**Counter-example**: If both sides modified the same entry's pattern or handler, resolve to `Manual`.

### R-UVLOCK-REGENERATE

**File pattern**: `uv.lock` (exact path at repo top).
**Conflict scope**: Any.
**Resolution mode**: **special** — `uv.lock` is not classified as `Auto`/`Manual` for textual merge. Instead, the auto-rebase orchestrator:

1. Holds a global file lock via `specify_cli.core.file_lock` to prevent concurrent regenerations across lanes.
2. Discards both sides of the conflict (the file is fully regenerated).
3. Runs `uv lock --no-upgrade` from the repo root.
4. Commits the regenerated `uv.lock`.

If `uv lock` exits non-zero, the orchestrator halts with the stderr surfaced to the operator.

### R-DEFAULT-MANUAL

**File pattern**: any file not matched by the rules above.
**Conflict scope**: any.
**Resolution**: `Manual` with `reason="no classifier rule matched <file_path>"`.

This rule is **always last** in the rule list. It is the fail-safe default mandated by NFR-005.

## Rule list ordering

```python
RULES: tuple[ClassifierRule, ...] = (
    R_PYPROJECT_DEPS_UNION,
    R_INIT_IMPORTS_UNION,
    R_URLS_LIST_UNION,
    R_UVLOCK_REGENERATE,      # special-cased in the orchestrator
    R_DEFAULT_MANUAL,
)
```

First match wins. `R_DEFAULT_MANUAL` is always reachable because no preceding rule has an unbounded pattern.

## Fail-safe invariants (NFR-005)

1. Any input not exactly matching one of the named rules MUST resolve to `Manual`.
2. A rule MUST resolve to `Manual` if its conflict shape predicate raises ANY exception during evaluation. The classifier wraps each rule's shape predicate in a `try/except` that defaults to `Manual` on raise.
3. The orchestrator MUST verify, after applying an `Auto` resolution, that the resulting file is syntactically valid for its type. For `pyproject.toml`: `tomllib.loads` succeeds. For Python files: `ast.parse` succeeds. If validation fails, the orchestrator reverts the file to its pre-merge state and reports `Manual(reason="post-merge validation failed: ...")`.

## Operator-visible behavior

### When all conflicts in a lane resolve to `Auto`

The orchestrator:

1. Applies each `Auto` resolution by writing the merged text and staging the file.
2. Runs the orchestrator's post-merge step (`uv lock` if `uv.lock` was conflicted; `ruff --fix --select I001` if any `__init__.py` was conflicted).
3. Creates a merge commit on the lane branch with message `"auto-rebase: <N> conflicts resolved by classifier rules [R-PYPROJECT-DEPS-UNION, ...]"`.
4. Continues the outer merge pipeline as if the lane had been merged cleanly.

### When any conflict in a lane resolves to `Manual`

The orchestrator:

1. Reverts any partial auto-resolutions in the lane worktree (`git merge --abort`).
2. Halts the outer merge pipeline.
3. Emits the same actionable error message that `spec-kitty merge` emits today: instructs the operator to run `git merge <mission-branch>` in the lane worktree and resolve manually.
4. Reports per-lane status in `AutoRebaseReport.classifications` for any future audit.

### When `uv.lock` regeneration fails

The orchestrator:

1. Aborts the lane merge.
2. Surfaces the `uv lock` stderr to the operator.
3. Records the failure in `AutoRebaseReport.halt_reason`.
4. Does NOT retry — operator intervention required (likely a `pyproject.toml` issue that survived `R-PYPROJECT-DEPS-UNION`).

## Examples

### Example 1: R-PYPROJECT-DEPS-UNION (auto-resolve)

Lane A's `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
  "httpx>=0.27",
  "ruamel-yaml",
]
```

Lane B's `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
  "httpx>=0.27",
  "freezegun",
  "ruamel-yaml",
]
```

Mission branch's `pyproject.toml` (after Lane A merged):

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
  "httpx>=0.27",
  "ruamel-yaml",
  "requests-mock",
]
```

Lane B is stale; conflict on the `dependencies` array. R-PYPROJECT-DEPS-UNION matches.

**Auto-resolved result**:

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
  "freezegun",
  "httpx>=0.27",
  "requests-mock",
  "ruamel-yaml",
]
```

(Sorted because the existing file in this example was sorted — match the surrounding pattern.)

### Example 2: Counter-example — version specifier conflict (Manual)

Lane A adds `httpx>=0.27`; Lane B adds `httpx>=0.28`. R-PYPROJECT-DEPS-UNION does NOT match (the rule's shape predicate excludes same-package version drift). Resolves to `Manual`. The orchestrator halts and the operator decides.

### Example 3: R-INIT-IMPORTS-UNION (auto-resolve)

Lane A's `apps/collaboration/__init__.py`:

```python
from .auth import AuthFlow
from .flags import FeatureFlags
```

Lane B's `apps/collaboration/__init__.py`:

```python
from .flags import FeatureFlags
from .sync import SyncClient
```

R-INIT-IMPORTS-UNION matches.

**Auto-resolved result** (after `ruff --fix --select I001`):

```python
from .auth import AuthFlow
from .flags import FeatureFlags
from .sync import SyncClient
```

### Example 4: Counter-example — modification of an existing import (Manual)

Lane A changes `from .auth import AuthFlow` to `from .auth import OAuthFlow`. Lane B adds `from .sync import SyncClient`. R-INIT-IMPORTS-UNION does NOT match because Lane A modified an existing import (not added a new one). Resolves to `Manual`.

## Testing contract

Per `function-over-form-testing`:

- **Per-rule unit tests** (`tests/integration/merge/test_conflict_classifier.py`): parametrized `(file_path, hunk_text, expected_resolution)` triples for each rule. Cover both happy auto-resolve and the rule's counter-example.
- **Orchestrator integration tests** (`tests/integration/lanes/test_auto_rebase_additive.py`): two-lane scenario with `pyproject.toml` + `__init__.py` adds; assert the outer merge pipeline completes; assert the resulting `pyproject.toml` parses as TOML and contains the union of dependencies.
- **Negative integration tests**: two-lane scenario with a semantic conflict; assert the orchestrator halts with the current actionable error message; assert no partial auto-resolution leaks to the lane worktree.
- **Fail-safe smoke**: feed the classifier a file pattern not covered by any rule; assert `R-DEFAULT-MANUAL` fires with the documented reason.

## Open questions for the operator

(Before promoting this draft to the canonical ADR file under `architecture/2.x/adr/`.)

1. **Should the auto-rebase commit message cite the specific lane being rebased?** Yes — the message format includes `lane=<id>` to aid post-merge audit.
2. **Should `ruff --fix --select I001` be expanded to additional rule sets** (e.g. `--select E,F`)? **No** — broaden only if operator-experience shows the import-only fix is insufficient. Keep minimal.
3. **Should the `R-URLS-LIST-UNION` rule attempt to detect the file's sort convention** (alphabetical vs insertion order)? **Yes** — sample the unmodified prefix of the list; if sorted, sort the union; otherwise preserve relative order. This is part of the rule's implementation; document it here so reviewers know it's deliberate.

## Status

PROPOSED. Promoted to `architecture/2.x/adr/2026-05-14-1-stale-lane-auto-rebase-classifier-policy.md` (status: ACCEPTED) once operator approval is recorded in the WP08 evidence. Implementation is gated on that promotion (C-007).
