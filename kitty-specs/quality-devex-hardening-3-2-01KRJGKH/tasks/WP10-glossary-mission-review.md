## ⚡ Do This First: Load Agent Profile

```
/ad-hoc-profile-load reviewer-renata
```

The profile establishes the reviewer identity (Reviewer Renata — design-and-quality review across mission artifacts) and avoidance boundary (no implementation work, no architectural redesign, no doctrine creation). For glossary consolidation, also consult curator-carla's tactics on glossary curation.

If the profile load fails, stop and surface the error — do not improvise.

## Objective

Close the mission. This WP:

1. Consolidates all WP01..WP09 glossary fragments into the canonical `.kittify/glossaries/spec_kitty_core.yaml`.
2. Verifies the architecture code-patterns catalog reflects the in-tree changes from WP03.
3. Authors the mission-review report citing every doctrine tactic applied per WP.
4. Runs the NFR-001 release-stability smoke (fresh-user init → specify → plan → tasks → implement → review → merge → PR).
5. Updates CHANGELOG.md with the mission's six-ticket closeout.

This WP is "planning_artifact" execution-mode — its outputs are documentation and mission-state artifacts, not new production code.

## Context

### Per-WP glossary fragments (inputs)

Each of WP01..WP09 left a fragment at `kitty-specs/quality-devex-hardening-3-2-01KRJGKH/glossary-fragments/WPxx.md`. WP10 reads all nine and consolidates the distinct canonical terms into the shipped glossary YAML.

Expected entries per the spec's Domain Language section:

- `structural debt` (introduced by WP06)
- `deliberate linearity` (introduced by WP06)
- `pipeline-shape` (introduced by WP03)
- `rule pipeline` (introduced by WP03; covers Validator/Transformer/Scorer flavors)
- `characterization test` (introduced by WP02)
- `Sonar quality gate` (introduced by WP07)
- `catastrophic backtracking` (introduced by WP04)

If any term is missing from the fragments, audit the source WP's evidence to recover the definition; if truly absent, escalate to the operator.

## Doctrine Citations

This WP applies the **review** posture, not authorship — it audits the mission's adherence to the doctrine cited per WP:

- [`function-over-form-testing`](../../../src/doctrine/tactics/shipped/testing/function-over-form-testing.tactic.yaml) — verify every new test in WP01..WP09 complies. Reject otherwise.
- [`chain-of-responsibility-rule-pipeline`](../../../src/doctrine/tactics/shipped/code-patterns/chain-of-responsibility-rule-pipeline.tactic.yaml) — verify WP03 cites the tactic and updates the catalog.
- [`secure-regex-catastrophic-backtracking`](../../../src/doctrine/tactics/shipped/secure-regex-catastrophic-backtracking.tactic.yaml) — verify WP04 cites the tactic and lands wall-clock regression tests.
- [`tdd-red-green-refactor`](../../../src/doctrine/tactics/shipped/testing/tdd-red-green-refactor.tactic.yaml) — verify characterization-test commits precede refactor commits (NFR-003) for WP03 and WP06.

## Branch Strategy

- Planning / base branch: `fix/quality-check-updates`.
- Final merge target: `fix/quality-check-updates`.

## Subtasks

### T053 — Consolidate WP01..WP09 glossary fragments into `spec_kitty_core.yaml`

**Purpose**: Land the canonical terms in the shipped glossary file. FR-013 acceptance.

**Steps**:

1. Read each `kitty-specs/quality-devex-hardening-3-2-01KRJGKH/glossary-fragments/WPxx.md` (WP01..WP09).
2. Extract each canonical-term entry (surface, definition, confidence, status).
3. Open `.kittify/glossaries/spec_kitty_core.yaml`. For each new term:
   - Verify the term is not already present (avoid duplicate `surface`).
   - Insert the entry in alphabetical order under `terms:`.
   - Use `status: active` (or `draft` if the WP marked it draft).
4. Cross-reference each entry against the spec's Domain Language table. Every term in that table MUST appear in the glossary after this subtask.
5. Run a sanity check:
   ```bash
   yq '.terms[] | select(.status == "active") | .surface' .kittify/glossaries/spec_kitty_core.yaml | sort -u > /tmp/active-terms.txt
   for term in "structural debt" "deliberate linearity" "pipeline-shape" "rule pipeline" "characterization test" "Sonar quality gate" "catastrophic backtracking"; do
     grep -Fxq "$term" /tmp/active-terms.txt || echo "MISSING: $term"
   done
   ```
   Expected output: empty (no missing terms).

**Files**: `.kittify/glossaries/spec_kitty_core.yaml` (modified, ~7 new entries).

**Validation**:

- Every Domain Language term from spec.md appears in the glossary with `status: active`.
- No duplicate surfaces.
- YAML schema validates.

### T054 — Verify code-patterns catalog cites `migration/canonicalization.py`

**Purpose**: Confirm WP03 updated the catalog correctly.

**Steps**:

1. Read `architecture/2.x/04_implementation_mapping/code-patterns.md`.
2. Verify the "1. Rule-Based Pipeline (Chain of Responsibility)" section's Transformer-flavor bullet cites `src/specify_cli/migration/canonicalization.py` as the canonical implementation, with both `mission_state.py` and `rebuild_state.py` listed as consumers.
3. If the update is missing or incorrect, escalate to WP03's owner — do NOT modify the catalog in WP10. WP03 owns the catalog entry per its `owned_files`.

**Files**: none (verification only).

**Validation**:

- Catalog reflects the in-tree implementation.

### T055 — Author `mission-review.md`

**Purpose**: NFR-006 — the mission-review report lists every doctrine tactic applied per WP and links the code-patterns catalog.

**Steps**:

1. Create `kitty-specs/quality-devex-hardening-3-2-01KRJGKH/mission-review.md`.
2. Structure:
   - **Header**: mission ID, branch, review date, reviewer identity.
   - **Tickets resolved**: table of #971, #825, #595, #629, #771, #740 with resolution status (closed-with-evidence / deferred-with-rationale).
   - **Per-WP doctrine table**: each WP, the doctrine tactics it applied (cited by id), the artifacts produced.
   - **Code-patterns catalog updates**: confirm the catalog cites `migration/canonicalization.py` and any other patterns updated.
   - **Glossary updates**: list every canonical term added in this mission, citing the introducing WP.
   - **Acceptance evidence**:
     - Sonar gate status `OK` on `main` (capture the REST-helper output as evidence).
     - mypy strict exit 0 (capture command output).
     - Push-time Sonar runs successfully (link to a `gh run view` evidence).
     - NFR-001 smoke (from T056) results.
   - **Open items / follow-ups**: any deferred work documented per `work/findings/` + epic update.
   - **Sign-off**: explicit "release-ready" or "not-yet-ready" call with rationale.
3. Apply the `function-over-form-testing` reviewer lens — reject any WP whose tests are structural; document the rejection in the mission-review.

**Files**: `kitty-specs/quality-devex-hardening-3-2-01KRJGKH/mission-review.md` (new, ~250 lines).

**Validation**:

- Every preceding WP appears in the per-WP table with its tactics cited by id.
- All four acceptance evidence items are captured.

### T056 — Run NFR-001 release-stability smoke

**Purpose**: Verify the post-merge `main` supports a fresh-user cycle without manual repair.

**Steps**:

1. In a throwaway directory:
   ```bash
   spec-kitty init smoke-test --agent claude
   cd smoke-test
   spec-kitty agent mission create smoke --friendly-name "Smoke" \
     --purpose-tldr "NFR-001 release-stability smoke for quality-devex-hardening-3-2-01KRJGKH" \
     --purpose-context "Verifies the post-mission main supports a fresh-user cycle without manual state repair or branch reconstruction." --json
   ```
2. Walk through specify → plan → tasks → implement (one trivial WP) → review → merge → PR. Use the cheapest possible mission body (e.g. "hello world").
3. Record at each step: exit code, any error messages, whether manual repair was needed.
4. If any step requires manual repair, document in `mission-review.md` as a NFR-001 failure and escalate to the operator — the mission cannot be marked release-ready otherwise.

**Files**: smoke artifacts in the throwaway dir; results captured in `mission-review.md`.

**Validation**:

- Full cycle completes; PR opens cleanly on GitHub.
- No manual repair steps recorded.

### T057 — Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the mission's deliverables

**Purpose**: Cross-reference all six tickets + key decisions + ADR landing.

**Steps**:

1. Read each `kitty-specs/quality-devex-hardening-3-2-01KRJGKH/changelog-fragments/WPxx.md` (WP01..WP09 produced these).
2. Open `CHANGELOG.md`. Author a new section under the appropriate version (likely `## [Unreleased]` or `## [3.2.0]` if the release is imminent):
   - **Added**: stale-lane auto-rebase classifier (#771) with ADR 2026-05-14-1; no-upgrade UX notification (#740) with `SPEC_KITTY_NO_UPGRADE_CHECK` opt-out; `secure-regex-catastrophic-backtracking` and `chain-of-responsibility-rule-pipeline` doctrine tactics; `architecture/2.x/04_implementation_mapping/code-patterns.md` core code-patterns catalog.
   - **Changed**: mypy strict baseline now green for `src/specify_cli src/charter src/doctrine` per decision moment DM-01KRJHT7QD7XQMY33Y5TDTQ80V (option A; #971); push-time Sonar restored (#825) after gate-debt cleanup (#595); `_canonicalize_status_row` refactored onto `CanonicalRule` Protocol with characterization-test coverage; `doctor.py::mission_state` refactored from CC 57 to a thin orchestrator + per-mode runners.
   - **Fixed**: Sonar regex hotspots in `release/changelog.py` with wall-clock regression tests; `doctor.py:1092` `MissionRepairResult.findings` real-branch bug; missing Windows symlink-fallback test for `m_0_8_0` migration (#629).
   - **Documentation**: `secure-regex-catastrophic-backtracking` tactic; `chain-of-responsibility-rule-pipeline` tactic; code-patterns catalog; ADR 2026-05-14-1.
3. Cross-reference all six issue numbers explicitly.

**Files**: `CHANGELOG.md` (modified, ~30 line addition).

**Validation**:

- CHANGELOG section is coherent and stakeholder-readable.
- Every ticket number appears.

### T058 — Glossary fragment for WP10 (audit-pass record)

**Purpose**: Record that WP10 ran the consolidation.

**Steps**:

1. Author `kitty-specs/quality-devex-hardening-3-2-01KRJGKH/glossary-fragments/WP10.md`:
   - `# WP10 consolidated WP01..WP09 glossary fragments. No new canonical terms introduced.`

**Files**: `kitty-specs/quality-devex-hardening-3-2-01KRJGKH/glossary-fragments/WP10.md` (new, ~3 lines).

## Test Strategy

This WP authors documentation and runs the release smoke. No new behavior tests.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Every Domain Language term from `spec.md` appears in `.kittify/glossaries/spec_kitty_core.yaml` with `status: active`.
- [ ] Code-patterns catalog cites `migration/canonicalization.py` (verified, not modified, in this WP).
- [ ] `mission-review.md` exists with per-WP doctrine table + acceptance evidence + sign-off.
- [ ] NFR-001 smoke completes successfully (recorded in `mission-review.md`).
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` documents the mission's deliverables and cross-references all six tickets.
- [ ] `glossary-fragments/WP10.md` exists.
- [ ] Mission-review signs off "release-ready" OR explicitly states "not-yet-ready" with blockers enumerated.

## Risks

- **NFR-001 smoke surfaces a real regression** in post-merge `main`. The mission cannot be marked release-ready. Pedro/Reviewer escalates immediately; operator decides whether to fix-then-ship or defer.
- **A WP's glossary fragment is missing or incomplete**. Recover the term definition from the WP's evidence or the spec; if neither has it, escalate to the operator for a definition.
- **CHANGELOG entry conflicts with a parallel release**. Reconcile with the latest CHANGELOG state at merge time; the consolidation happens at WP10 to centralize this risk.

## Reviewer Guidance

This WP IS the review. The implementer (running as `reviewer-renata`) acts as the mission's review authority. Their work is reviewed by the operator (HiC) at the mission-merge gate.

## Implementation command

```bash
spec-kitty agent action implement WP10 --agent claude
```
