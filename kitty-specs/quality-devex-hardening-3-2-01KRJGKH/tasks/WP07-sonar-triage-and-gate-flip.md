## ⚡ Do This First: Load Agent Profile

```
/ad-hoc-profile-load python-pedro
```

## Objective

Triage the remaining 5 non-regex Sonar security hotspots (loopback `127.0.0.1` × 4 in auth/sync callback paths; review-lock signal safety × 1) and flip the push-time Sonar gate. The flip is the final acceptance for FR-004 (#825) and is gated on Sonar status = OK on `main`.

Pedro note: this WP is partly outside Python-implementer specialization (the CI yaml change is infra). Coordinate the workflow flip with the infra reviewer; the hotspot triage is in Pedro's scope (rationale wording for safe-by-design findings + any small code fix).

## Context

### Hotspots to resolve

From `work/findings/595-sonar-coverage-debt.md`:

1. **Loopback `http://127.0.0.1` (4 hotspots)** — in the auth callback server and sync callback paths. Sonar flags any literal loopback URL as a potential information-disclosure / SSRF risk. In this codebase, the loopback URLs are intentional: the OAuth callback server is local-only by design.
2. **Review-lock signal safety (1 hotspot)** — Sonar flags signal-handler installation in `review/lock.py` (or similar) as potentially unsafe. Triage on its merits — either fix or document.

### Workflow current state

`.github/workflows/ci-quality.yml::sonarcloud` line 1976:

```yaml
if: always() && (github.event_name == 'schedule' || github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch')
```

The header comment block above the job says:
> Temporarily limited to schedule/manual runs while #825 tracks the existing project-wide Sonar quality gate backlog.

Both the conditional and the comment block must be updated.

## Doctrine Citations

This WP applies:

- [`secure-design-checklist`](../../../src/doctrine/tactics/shipped/secure-design-checklist.tactic.yaml) — applied to the review-lock signal-safety hotspot if a code fix is needed (security-sensitive surface).

## Branch Strategy

- Planning / base branch: `fix/quality-check-updates`.
- Final merge target: `fix/quality-check-updates`.

## Subtasks

### T035 — Triage `127.0.0.1` loopback hotspots (safe-by-design rationale)

**Purpose**: Move 4 hotspots from "unreviewed" to "safe" in Sonar.

**Steps**:

1. Identify each `127.0.0.1` hotspot via:
   ```bash
   bash work/snippets/sonarcloud_branch_review.sh Priivacy-ai_spec-kitty main | grep -B1 -A2 "127.0.0.1"
   ```
2. For each hotspot, read the surrounding code:
   - `src/specify_cli/auth/loopback/callback_server.py`
   - `src/specify_cli/sync/...` (whichever callback variant Sonar flagged)
3. Author a rationale (one paragraph per hotspot) for the safe-by-design call:
   - The OAuth callback server binds to `127.0.0.1` by design — that is the entire point of the loopback flow (RFC 8252 §7.3). The server accepts only the one-time authorization code; it does not expose any other endpoint or accept any other data.
   - The bound port is ephemeral and the server lifetime is short (only during the auth flow).
   - There is no information-disclosure risk because the address is `localhost`, accessible only from the same host.
4. Record this rationale in the Sonar UI for each hotspot.
5. If Sonar UI access is unavailable, write the rationales into `kitty-specs/quality-devex-hardening-3-2-01KRJGKH/sonar-hotspot-rationales.md` and request a maintainer with Sonar admin rights to apply them.

**Validation**:

- The 4 loopback hotspots move from "unreviewed" to "safe" in Sonar.
- `new_security_hotspots_reviewed` percentage rises.

### T036 — Triage review-lock signal-safety hotspot

**Purpose**: Resolve the remaining hotspot.

**Steps**:

1. Identify the file via:
   ```bash
   bash work/snippets/sonarcloud_branch_review.sh Priivacy-ai_spec-kitty main | grep -i "signal\|lock"
   ```
2. Read the flagged code. Sonar flags signal-handler installation that:
   - Calls non-async-signal-safe functions from the handler.
   - Installs handlers in unexpected scopes.
   - Does not restore previous handlers on cleanup.
3. Determine if a code fix is warranted:
   - If the handler calls non-AS-safe functions (e.g. `logging.warning`, file writes), fix: defer to a flag set in the handler, then process on the main path.
   - If the handler is correct, record a safe-by-design rationale per T035's pattern.
4. If a code fix is needed AND it crosses `owned_files` outside this WP, escalate to the operator. The default is "rationale only" unless the operator approves the code fix scope expansion.

**Validation**:

- The hotspot is either fixed in code or reviewed with documented rationale in Sonar.

### T037 — Verify Sonar gate is OK on `main`

**Purpose**: Pre-flip verification. The trigger flip cannot land unless the gate is already green.

**Steps**:

1. Run:
   ```bash
   bash work/snippets/sonarcloud_branch_review.sh Priivacy-ai_spec-kitty main | head -20
   ```
2. Confirm:
   ```
   === Quality Gate ===
   status: OK
   ```
3. Confirm every gate condition:
   - `new_reliability_rating: OK`
   - `new_security_rating: OK`
   - `new_maintainability_rating: OK`
   - `new_coverage: OK` (i.e. ≥ 80 % per the threshold)
   - `new_duplicated_lines_density: OK`
   - `new_security_hotspots_reviewed: OK` (i.e. 100 %)
4. If any condition is `ERROR`, do NOT proceed to T038. Re-coordinate with the relevant upstream WP (likely WP05 for coverage; T035/T036 for hotspots).
5. Save the verification output as WP07 evidence (`kitty-specs/quality-devex-hardening-3-2-01KRJGKH/sonar-pre-flip-verification.txt`).

**Validation**:

- Sonar `status: OK` on `main`.
- Every condition `OK`.

### T038 — Flip `.github/workflows/ci-quality.yml::sonarcloud` trigger to `always()`

**Purpose**: Restore push-time Sonar.

**Steps**:

1. Open `.github/workflows/ci-quality.yml`.
2. Locate the `sonarcloud:` job (around line 1944 per current main).
3. Update the `if:` line:
   ```yaml
   # BEFORE
   if: always() && (github.event_name == 'schedule' || github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch')

   # AFTER
   if: always()
   ```
4. Remove the temporary header comment block:
   ```yaml
   # DELETE these lines:
   # Temporarily limited to schedule/manual runs while #825 tracks the existing
   # project-wide Sonar quality gate backlog. PRs skip Sonar entirely to keep
   # review latency low, and pushes skip it so main can report test/build health.
   # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ```
5. Commit and push.
6. Trigger a `main` push (e.g. via this WP's PR merge) and verify the next `CI Quality` workflow run shows the `sonarcloud` step as `success`, not `skipped`.

**Files**: `.github/workflows/ci-quality.yml` (modified, ~5 line change).

**Validation**:

- `if: always()` condition is in place.
- Deferral comment block is removed.
- Next push run shows `sonarcloud` step `success`.

### T039 — Glossary fragment for "Sonar quality gate"

**Purpose**: FR-013.

**Steps**:

1. Author `kitty-specs/quality-devex-hardening-3-2-01KRJGKH/glossary-fragments/WP07.md`:
   - **`Sonar quality gate`**: "The SonarCloud project-level pass/fail evaluation for `Priivacy-ai_spec-kitty` on the new-code window. Aggregates six conditions (reliability rating, security rating, maintainability rating, new coverage, new duplicated lines density, new security hotspots reviewed). Reports `OK` or `ERROR` per condition + a top-level status. Pulled via the public REST API at `https://sonarcloud.io/api/qualitygates/project_status`; the helper `work/snippets/sonarcloud_branch_review.sh` formats this for terminal use." Confidence 0.95. Status active.
2. Stage and commit.

**Files**: `kitty-specs/quality-devex-hardening-3-2-01KRJGKH/glossary-fragments/WP07.md` (new, ~15 lines).

## Test Strategy

- This WP has no new behavior tests. The `function-over-form-testing` discipline does not extend to CI yaml or Sonar UI rationale.
- The "test" is the next-push verification at T038.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Each non-regex Sonar hotspot (5 total) has a Sonar UI review (safe-by-design rationale or code-fix). `new_security_hotspots_reviewed` = 100 %.
- [ ] Sonar gate status `OK` on `main` (verified via the REST helper).
- [ ] `.github/workflows/ci-quality.yml::sonarcloud` runs on push events to `main`; deferral comment block removed.
- [ ] Next push to `main` produces a successful `sonarcloud` job run (verified via `gh run view`).
- [ ] `glossary-fragments/WP07.md` carries "Sonar quality gate" entry.

## Risks

- **Race condition**: another mission merges between gate-verification and trigger-flip and re-introduces gate-failing code. Mitigation: re-run the Sonar verification immediately before pushing the trigger-flip commit; if gate has regressed, coordinate with the merge-triggering mission's owner.
- **Sonar UI access**: if Pedro cannot apply rationales directly in Sonar, record them in `sonar-hotspot-rationales.md` and coordinate with a Sonar admin.
- **`_auth_doctor.render_report` (CC 53, deliberate linearity)**: if Sonar's maintainability rating fails because of this function, escalate per spec C-003 — do NOT refactor without auth-maintainer sign-off. Resolution path: per-file Sonar rationale annotation.

## Reviewer Guidance

When reviewing this WP, check:

1. Every hotspot has a Sonar review — none remain unreviewed.
2. Loopback rationales cite RFC 8252 §7.3 (or equivalent) and explicitly state "localhost-only, ephemeral, single-use".
3. Sonar status `OK` on `main` BEFORE the workflow trigger flip lands.
4. The workflow change is the minimal `if:` flip + comment-block deletion — no unrelated workflow modifications.
5. No `_auth_doctor.render_report` refactor was attempted (constraint C-003).
