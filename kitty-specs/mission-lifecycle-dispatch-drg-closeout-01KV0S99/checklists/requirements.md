# Specification Quality Checklist: Mission lifecycle, dispatch & DRG closeout

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) — spec states WHAT (dispatch mechanism, lifecycle surface, curation) not HOW
- [x] Focused on user/maintainer value and ticket closure
- [x] Written for stakeholders (ties each workstream to a closeable ticket)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (3 scope decisions resolved in discovery: #1802 deliver, #1810 implement, #1863 fix-stale+document)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Requirement types are separated (FR / NFR / C)
- [x] IDs are unique across FR-### / NFR-### / C-###
- [x] All requirement rows include a Status value
- [x] Non-functional requirements include measurable/verifiable thresholds (byte/contract-identical aliases; deterministic regen; zero-new ruff/mypy)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (each = a specific ticket closing)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (ticket-closure + behavior outcomes)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined (follow-up, re-open, dispatch, curation)
- [x] Edge cases identified (deleted branch on re-open; alias Op-identity parity; dangling orphan)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (C-005 names explicit out-of-scope: #1913/#1914, #1916, #1907, #1010)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria (via SC-1..SC-4 ticket closures)
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (all three workstreams)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes (ticket closure = SC)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- C-002 (dispatch back-compat) is BINDING and safety-critical: this very workflow runs governed Ops via `spec-kitty do --profile …`; the collapse must never break the trio. Carried into plan as a hard sequencing constraint (aliases land with the unified mechanism, atomically).
- #1810 is additive (new canonical `dispatch` + retained verb aliases), NOT a rename → not a bulk-edit/occurrence-map mission.
- All four addressed issues (#1802/#1804/#1810/#1863) are in issue-matrix.md, claimed (assigned), and commented on the tracker.
