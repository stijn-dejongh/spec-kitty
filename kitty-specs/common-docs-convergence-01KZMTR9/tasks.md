# Tasks: Common Docs Convergence

**Mission**: `common-docs-convergence-01KZMTR9` | **Branch**: `docs/common-docs-cleanup`
**Plan**: [plan.md](./plan.md) · **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md) · **Reviews**: [post-spec](./reviews/post-spec-squad.md), [post-plan](./reviews/post-plan-squad.md)

Subtask completion is event-sourced — record with `spec-kitty agent tasks mark-status Txxx --status done`.
The `Txxx` rows below are reference rows, not checkboxes.

## Ownership model (post-plan squad, C-011)
Partitioned by **destination-section ownership**: each `docs/` section is owned by exactly one mover
WP; all shared manifests (`redirect_map.yaml`, `toc.yml`, `docfx.json`, `llms.txt`, per-section toc,
inventory lockfiles, `docs/plans/**` link-targets, `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`) are written ONLY by the
terminal reconcile WP13. Movers emit per-WP occurrence-map ledger fragments that WP13 merges. Content
**rewrites (IC-08)** are done as a distinct, separately-reviewed PHASE inside each mover WP (with the
NFR-009 fidelity ledger) rather than as separate WPs — this honors "rewrite reviewed apart from move"
while keeping `owned_files` collision-free.

## Dependency graph
```
WP01 doctrine ┐
WP02 audience ┤─→ WP04 gates ─→ WP05,WP06,WP07,WP08,WP09,WP10,WP11,WP12 (movers) ─→ WP13 reconcile+block
WP03 spine    ┘                         (WP09,WP10 need WP01; WP06/WP09 rehome from root)
WP08 (adr/migrations) may start after WP03 (renames need the spine)
```

Goal: canonize the `audience:` field and the audience-based routing/lint config in the doctrine SSOT so
everything downstream consumes one authority. Priority: P1. Independent test: 042/047/styleguide declare

the new invariant fields. Subtasks: T001–T004. Deps: none. Requirement refs: FR-002, FR-009, FR-023.
owned_files: `packs/built-in/directives/042-common-docs.directive.yaml`, `packs/built-in/directives/047-audience-oriented-writing.directive.yaml`, `packs/built-in/styleguides/common-docs.styleguide.yaml`.

## MVP / sequencing
Foundations WP01–WP04 are the MVP enabling everything. Movers WP05–WP12 run after WP04 (WP09/WP10 also
after WP01). WP13 is terminal after all movers. WP08 is the most independent mover.
