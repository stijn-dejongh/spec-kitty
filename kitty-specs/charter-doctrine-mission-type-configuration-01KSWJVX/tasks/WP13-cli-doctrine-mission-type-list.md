# Work Package Prompt: WP13 — CLI: spec-kitty doctrine mission-type list

## Context

FR-013 requires `spec-kitty doctrine mission-type list` to enumerate all doctrine templates. The `spec-kitty doctrine` CLI group already exists. This WP adds the `mission-type` sub-group with a `list` subcommand.

This command lists ALL mission types visible in the doctrine layer (built-in + org overrides + project overrides) — **regardless of activation state**. This is different from `spec-kitty charter mission-type list` (WP14), which lists only activated types.

The command is read-only and works from any project directory.

## Objective

Add `spec-kitty doctrine mission-type list [--kind]` to the existing `doctrine` CLI group. Wire it to `MissionTypeRepository` for layer-aware enumeration. Support `--json` output.

## Command Specification

```
spec-kitty doctrine mission-type list [--json]
```

Output columns:
- `id` — mission type ID (e.g., `software-dev`)
- `source_layer` — `built-in`, `org`, or `project`
- `display_name` — human-readable name

Example output (table mode):
```
ID             SOURCE       DISPLAY NAME
software-dev   built-in     Software Development
documentation  built-in     Documentation
research       built-in     Research
plan           built-in     Plan
```

Example output (`--json`):
```json
[
  {"id": "software-dev", "source_layer": "built-in", "display_name": "Software Development"},
  ...
]
```

## Subtasks

### T077 — Verify doctrine CLI group is registered, then add mission-type sub-group

**Before adding any commands**, run `spec-kitty doctrine --help` (or equivalent) to verify the `doctrine` CLI group is registered in the main CLI. There was a prior incident (PR #1352) where the `spec-kitty doctrine` group was accidentally deregistered and a stale test masked the regression. Confirm the group is present and working before extending it.

If the group is missing: re-register it in the main CLI entry point (check `src/specify_cli/cli/main.py`), add a test that verifies `spec-kitty doctrine --help` exits 0, then proceed.

Open `src/specify_cli/cli/commands/doctrine.py`.

Find the `doctrine` typer app. Add a `mission_type` sub-app:

```python
mission_type_app = typer.Typer(name="mission-type", help="Mission type commands.")
doctrine_app.add_typer(mission_type_app)
```

If the `doctrine_app` structure is different, follow the existing pattern for adding sub-groups.

### T078 — Implement list sub-command

Add the `list` command to `mission_type_app`:

```python
@mission_type_app.command("list")
def mission_type_list(
    json_output: bool = typer.Option(False, "--json", help="Output as JSON."),
) -> None:
    """List all mission types in the doctrine layer (built-in, org, and project)."""
    ...
```

Implementation:
1. Instantiate `MissionTypeRepository` for the built-in layer
2. If a `PackContext` can be constructed (project has `.kittify/config.yaml`), also scan org and project layers
3. Collect all types with their source_layer annotation
4. Sort by source_layer (built-in first), then by id

Note: this command lists ALL types regardless of activation. An org or project override that provides a new type ID appears here even if not activated.

### T079 — Output formatting: table and JSON

Table output (default): use `rich.table.Table` for consistent formatting with other doctrine commands.

JSON output (`--json` flag): emit a JSON array of dicts with keys `id`, `source_layer`, `display_name`.

Follow the existing pattern in other `doctrine` commands for output formatting.

### T080 — Wire to MissionTypeRepository

`MissionTypeRepository` (from WP03) is the backend. The command:
1. Creates the repository pointing at `src/doctrine/missions/mission_types/` for the built-in layer
2. If org/project overlays exist (from `PackContext`), also creates repositories for those layers
3. Collects and deduplicates: if a type ID appears in multiple layers, the highest-precedence (project) layer wins but all layers are reported (or just the winning one — follow the FR-013 spec: "includes name, kind, source layer, and resolution path")

FR-014: The DRG resolution chain applies: `built-in → org → project`. An org type shadows a built-in type with the same ID; a project type shadows an org type.

### T081 — Tests for doctrine mission-type list

Write (or extend) `tests/cli/test_doctrine_commands.py`:

Test cases:
- Default invocation: returns at least the four built-in types
- All four built-in types appear with `source_layer: built-in`
- `--json` flag: output is valid JSON with the required keys
- No activation required: command works from a directory without `.kittify/config.yaml`
- Error handling: command exits gracefully if doctrine source path is missing

Use `typer.testing.CliRunner` for CLI tests.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `spec-kitty doctrine mission-type list` command exists and works
- [ ] Returns all four built-in types with `source_layer: built-in`
- [ ] `--json` output is valid JSON array
- [ ] Command does not require `.kittify/config.yaml` to work (built-in layer only is fine)
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] `mypy --strict` clean on `src/specify_cli/cli/commands/doctrine.py`
