## Objectives & Success Criteria

`doctor decisions`, `decision verify`, coordination teardown and consolidation must stop losing or hiding decisions. When this WP is done:

- **One read-only detector, `src/specify_cli/decisions/fork.py`**, compares both decision-event streams (`status.events.jsonl` decision events and `decisions.events.jsonl`) on both surfaces:
  - each surface is read from its working tree when present, else from its branch ref, so it works in a fresh clone;
  - it reports `forked` per stream and which decisions are on which surface (FR-010, US4.1).
- **`decision verify`** reports a forked Mission as not clean (`DECISION_LOG_FORKED`, exit 1). This is proven separately from doctor (FR-010a, US4.2).
- **`doctor decisions --repair`**:
  - never removes an index entry whose events exist on either surface, prints the reconcile steps, and never re-sequences (FR-011, C-003, US4.3);
  - still repairs a genuine orphan on an unforked Mission (positive control, US4.4).
- **A pre-fix coordination-only ledger** is reported (`DECISION_LEDGER_ONLY_ON_COORDINATION`), and `--repair` copies it additively into the PRIMARY-partition ledger dir with no auto-commit (FR-009c, US4.5).
- **Coordination teardown and consolidation refuse** to destroy a coordination branch that holds the only copy of a ledger (`COORDINATION_LEDGER_UNREPAIRED`, hint `spec-kitty doctor decisions --repair`; US4.6). The consolidation porcelain-invariant refusal for uncommitted ledger dirt, which is real work now that WP12 reclassified the ledger, names `accept`/`spec-commit`.
- **NFR-002 / SC-004:** across the four fork fixtures, 0 index entries and 0 events are lost.

## Context & Constraints

- **Spec**: FR-009c, FR-010, FR-010a, FR-011, FR-016 (R3, R14, R15, R16), SC-004, NFR-002, C-003; US4.1-4.6.
- **Plan**: IC-12. Shared-file map: `consolidation/executor.py` is touched by IC-11's reader message (here), IC-12 (here) and IC-18 (WP18). This WP is first; WP18 follows **in the same lane**.
- **Research**:
  - D14: detector inputs and callers;
  - D15: teardown refusal and the preflight;
  - D12: the consolidation porcelain invariant (`executor.py` ≈L2033-2041, inside `_phase_porcelain_invariant` at L2013) now treats ledger dirt as real work, so its message must name `accept`/`spec-commit`.
- **Contracts**: `contracts/doctor-decisions-fork-report.md` (report shape, rules 1-6, codes). Value objects are in `data-model.md` §4 (`SurfaceLog`, `StreamForkFinding`, `LedgerHomeFinding`, `DecisionsForkReport`).
- **Depends on**:
  - WP12: `DECISION_LEDGER` is PRIMARY; `artifacts.py`.
  - WP02: the NFR-002 fork fixtures `fork_fixture` (a)-(d) and the probes in `tests._factories.coord_mission`.
- **Charter**: `.kittify/charter/charter.md`; `spec-kitty charter context --action implement`. ATDD-first (C-011).
- **Model discipline**: implement = sonnet (`claude-sonnet-5`); review = opus.
- **Terminology**: say Mission, never feature. "PRIMARY partition" (where the ledger lives), "repository root checkout", "target branch", "coordination branch/surface". Never write bare "primary".
- **C-003**: never merge or re-sequence forked logs automatically; detect and guide only.
- **C-004**: fix forward; the repair is additive and rewrites no history.

## Branch Strategy

- **Strategy**: Planning artifacts were generated on issue-5440-coord-artifact-single-home; completed changes must merge back into issue-5440-coord-artifact-single-home.
- **Planning base branch**: issue-5440-coord-artifact-single-home
- **Merge target branch**: issue-5440-coord-artifact-single-home
- `finalize-tasks` allocates execution worktrees per computed lane from `lanes.json`. Start with `spec-kitty agent action implement WP17 --agent claude`, and use the resolved workspace path.
- **Lane sharing**: `src/specify_cli/consolidation/executor.py` is shared with WP18, which depends on this WP. That overlap is dependency-ordered and deliberate, so it runs in **lane B**: WP17 → WP18. Keep your executor edits to the three sites named in T096 so WP18's diff stays clean.

## Subtasks & Detailed Guidance

### Subtask T090 – Red-first reproductions over the NFR-002 fork fixtures (ATDD commit)

- **Purpose**: Pin each defect through its pre-existing entry point (C-005, FR-016) before any fix.
- **Steps**:
  1. **R3** `tests/decisions/test_decisions_reconciler.py::test_repair_never_drops_entries_on_forked_log`:
     - use WP02 fixture (a), root uncommitted plus coordination untracked (the #5519 shape);
     - count `decisions/index.json` entries, run the CLI `spec-kitty doctor decisions --mission <M> --repair --json`, count again;
     - assert the count is unchanged and the output names the fork.
     - Red at base: `_diagnose` builds `orphaned_in_index` from one surface's log (`_decisions_doctor.py:397`), and `_repair` drops those entries.
  2. **R15** `::test_doctor_reports_fork_from_refs_only`:
     - use fixture (c), a fresh clone of (b) with no coordination worktree;
     - run `doctor decisions --json` and assert `forked: true` with per-surface decision ids.
     - Red at base: the field is absent and the report is clean.
  3. **R16 (doctor half)** `::test_doctor_reports_and_repairs_coord_only_ledger`:
     - use fixture (d), a ledger only on the coordination branch;
     - assert `DECISION_LEDGER_ONLY_ON_COORDINATION` is reported;
     - after `--repair`, assert the missing `DM-*.md` files and index entries exist in the PRIMARY ledger dir, and no new commit was created.
  4. **R16 (teardown half)** `tests/coordination/test_projection_teardown.py::test_teardown_refuses_coord_only_ledger`: on fixture (d), `teardown_coordination_topology(...)` raises `ProjectionTeardownAbort` with `error_code == "COORDINATION_LEDGER_UNREPAIRED"`, and the coordination branch still exists.
  5. **R14** `tests/specify_cli/decisions/test_verify_integration.py::test_verify_not_clean_on_forked_log`: CLI `spec-kitty agent decision verify --mission <M> --json` on fixture (a) exits 1 with `DECISION_LOG_FORKED` in `findings[]`. At base it exits 0.
  6. Preflight: `tests/consolidation/test_executor_ledger_preflight.py::test_consolidation_preflight_refuses_coord_only_ledger` (`_pre_mutation_safety_preflight` refuses on fixture (d) before any ref moves). Also add `::test_porcelain_invariant_names_accept_for_ledger_dirt`.
  7. Run on your base. Confirm each is red for the stated reason, commit them alone (`test(decisions): red-first fork/repair/verify/teardown reproductions (WP17)`), and record the red evidence in the activity log.
- **Files**: the five test files above.
- **Edge cases**:
  - Fixture (b) committed both sides; its fork is visible in both refs and worktrees, so assert both inputs.
  - Use the WP02 probes (`event_ids`, `coord_tree_has`) rather than ad-hoc git calls.
  - No `xfail`.
- **R14 parametrized (post-tasks squad R-m1)**: parametrize `test_verify_not_clean_on_forked_log` over WP02's fork fixtures (a) root-uncommitted + coordination-untracked, (b) both committed, (c) fresh clone. Each must exit 1 with `DECISION_LOG_FORKED`.

### Subtask T091 – `detect_decision_forks` (read-only detector)

- **Purpose**: One detector shared by doctor, verify and teardown (research D14; DIRECTIVE_044, one authority).
- **Steps**:
  1. Create `src/specify_cli/decisions/fork.py` with frozen dataclasses per data-model §4: `SurfaceLog`, `StreamForkFinding`, `LedgerHomeFinding`, `DecisionsForkReport`. Use `Literal` types for `surface`, `source` and `state`.
  2. Define `detect_decision_forks(repo_root: Path, mission_slug: str) -> DecisionsForkReport`:
     - **PRIMARY side**: the repository root checkout's Mission dir (`placement_seam(...).read_dir(PRIMARY_METADATA)`) when the stream file is present; else `git show <target_branch>:kitty-specs/<dir>/<stream>` (target branch from `meta.json`).
     - **COORD side**: `CoordinationWorkspace.worktree_path` (coordination/workspace.py) when the Mission dir exists there; else `git show <coordination_branch>:kitty-specs/<dir>/<stream>` (`coordination_branch` from `meta.json`).
     - **Streams**: `status.events.jsonl` (decision events only, filtered by `event_type` prefix `Decision`; use the project's event parser rather than ad-hoc JSON) and `decisions.events.jsonl`.
     - **State per stream**: `absent` (neither side), `single_home` (one side only), `prefix` (one event-id sequence is a prefix of the other), `forked` (both non-empty, neither a prefix).
     - **Decision ids** grouped as only-on-primary, only-on-coordination and on-both.
     - `forked = any(stream.state == "forked")`; `reconcile_steps` is a tuple of human-readable steps (printed, never executed).
  3. **READ-ONLY**: never call `write_dir`, `materialize_coord_surface_for_write` or anything that creates worktrees. Assert this in a test by checking that `git worktree list` is unchanged.
  4. For non-coordination topologies, report the PRIMARY side only, with a `single_home` or `absent` state.
  5. Keep each function ≤ 15 C901: split the reading (`_read_stream(surface, ...)`), the comparison (`_classify_stream(R, C)`) and the grouping. Consider reusing WP03's pure prefix classifier if it is importable (`coord_seed`'s classifier) rather than duplicating the prefix rule. If it lives in `specify_cli.coordination.coord_seed`, importing it from `decisions/` is fine (same package); otherwise lift it.
- **Files**: `src/specify_cli/decisions/fork.py`; `tests/decisions/test_decision_fork_detector.py`, with table-driven tests over the four fixtures and each state, plus a non-coordination control.
- **Validation**: unit tests green; `tests/architectural/test_no_dead_symbols.py` passes, since the new public symbols are used by doctor, verify and teardown.
- **Edge cases**:
  - Malformed JSONL lines: surface them as a finding, never crash, never drop.
  - A missing branch (DELETED): treat that side as absent and add a warning.
  - `<dir>` naming: use the canonical Mission dir name (slug including mid8 where applicable) exactly as the seam resolves it.
- **Mandatory reuse (post-tasks squad P-M6, P-M4)**: classify streams with WP03's pure `coordination/event_prefix.py` classifier; no second prefix/fork implementation. Compose every Mission dir name only via `lanes.branch_naming` (`coord_mission_dir_name` and siblings); never hand-join `<slug>` or `<slug>-<mid8>`. Read the legacy `kitty-specs/<slug>/decisions.events.jsonl` shape exactly as WP09 ruled (this WP now depends on WP09).
- Named gate: `tests/architectural/test_no_worktree_name_guess.py`.

### Subtask T092 – `coordination_only_ledger`

- **Purpose**: Detect pre-fix Missions whose ledger was committed only on the coordination branch (FR-009c; the bookkeeping projection at `bookkeeping_projection.py:481` excludes PRIMARY kinds, so such a ledger would be lost at teardown).
- **Steps**:
  1. Define `coordination_only_ledger(repo_root, mission_slug) -> LedgerHomeFinding`.
  2. The PRIMARY side is `decisions/` in the repository root checkout's Mission dir, or at the target ref when absent there.
  3. The coordination side is `git ls-tree`/`git show` of `kitty-specs/<dir>/decisions/` on the coordination branch. Prefer refs here: the worktree copy may be stale, and the branch is what teardown destroys.
  4. Compute `entries_only_on_coordination` (index entries by `decision_id`) and `dm_files_only_on_coordination`, and derive `state` (`primary` / `coordination_only` / `both` / `absent`).
  5. Include it in `DecisionsForkReport.ledger`.
- **Files**: `fork.py`, `tests/decisions/test_decision_fork_detector.py`.
- **Validation**: fixture (d) yields `coordination_only`; a post-fix Mission yields `primary`; a Mission with no decisions yields `absent`.
- **Edge cases**: the coordination branch is missing yields `absent`/`primary` with no exception; the index exists but the DM file is missing (or vice versa) is reported per item.

### Subtask T093 – `doctor decisions` diagnosis: two-surface orphan rule and fork report

- **Purpose**: FR-010; contract rule 1.
- **Steps**:
  1. In `_decisions_doctor._diagnose` (L372), call `detect_decision_forks`.
  2. Replace the single-surface orphan computation (`orphaned_in_index=sorted(index_ids - log_ids)` at ≈L397): an id is orphaned only when absent from **every** stream on **both** surfaces (the union of all ids in the report).
  3. Extend the report dataclass (≈L101) additively with `forked`, `streams`, `ledger` and `reconcile_steps`.
  4. JSON (≈L519): add the keys per the contract envelope.
  5. Text (≈L500): one line per stream and surface, then the reconcile steps.
  6. Findings: `DECISION_LOG_FORKED` when `forked`; `DECISION_LEDGER_ONLY_ON_COORDINATION` when the ledger state is `coordination_only`, or `both` with entries only on the coordination side.
  7. Update `clean` (≈L128) so forked or coordination-only-ledger Missions are not clean.
  8. The ledger stays read on the PRIMARY partition (`_decisions_doctor.py:146-156`; FR-009a, WP12's ratchet). Do not change that read.
- **Files**: `src/specify_cli/cli/commands/_decisions_doctor.py`, `tests/decisions/test_decisions_reconciler.py`.
- **Validation**: R15 is green; existing reconciler tests (#4919 malformed folds, `status_mismatch`) stay green.
- **Edge cases**: a genuinely orphaned entry on an unforked Mission is still reported as orphaned (US4.4 control).

### Subtask T094 – Non-destructive `--repair` and coordination-only ledger copy

- **Purpose**: FR-011, FR-009c; contract rules 2-4.
- **Steps**:
  1. In `_repair` (L404) and `run_decisions_reconciliation` (L529; repair gate ≈L572, exit ≈L589):
     - when `forked` is true, perform **no** index rewrite for the forked decisions, print `reconcile_steps`, and exit 1 (C-003: no re-sequencing);
     - non-forked missing entries may still be added, but never remove an entry whose events exist on either surface.
  2. On an unforked Mission, keep today's repair: drop a genuine orphan and add `missing_from_index`. This is the positive control.
  3. Coordination-only ledger:
     - copy the missing `DM-*.md` files from the coordination ref into the PRIMARY ledger dir (the `_ledger_dir` resolution that `decisions/service.py` already uses: PRIMARY_METADATA);
     - union-merge the missing index entries into `index.json`;
     - do both under the existing `index.json.lock` (`_LOCK_FILENAME`, L86);
     - additive only: never overwrite an existing PRIMARY entry or file.
  4. Print the commit hint `spec-kitty spec-commit -m "…" kitty-specs/<dir>/decisions/`. Make **no commit** (FR-009b: the existing PRIMARY committers commit it).
  5. Exit codes:
     - forked: 1;
     - malformed remaining: 1 (today's behaviour);
     - otherwise 0.
- **Files**: `_decisions_doctor.py`, `tests/decisions/test_decisions_reconciler.py`.
- **Validation**: R3 and R16 (doctor half) are green; US4.4 control is green; NFR-002 assertion across fixtures (a)-(d): entry count after ≥ before, and no event file modified.
- **Edge cases**:
  - The index merge must use the same entry ordering as the index writer (`created_at`, then `decision_id`) so the result is deterministic.
  - A DM file present on both sides with different content: keep the PRIMARY one, and report the difference.
- **Shared union (P-M6)**: the coordination-only-ledger repair merges index entries with WP11's pure `union_decision_index(ours, theirs)`. Do not write a second union.

### Subtask T095 – `decision verify` reports forks

- **Purpose**: FR-010a; contract rule 5.
- **Steps**:
  1. In `decisions/verify.py::verify` (L104), call `detect_decision_forks(repo_root, mission_slug)`. Resolve `repo_root` from `mission_dir` the way the module already does, or extend the signature carefully; the `mission_slug` parameter is currently unused (`# noqa: ARG001`), so start using it and drop that noqa.
  2. Add the finding `DECISION_LOG_FORKED`, with the forked decision ids, to `findings`.
  3. In the CLI `cmd_verify` (`cli/commands/decision.py:567-599`), make sure a forked result exits 1 and appears in JSON `findings[]`. Existing findings (`DEFERRED_WITHOUT_MARKER`, `MARKER_WITHOUT_DECISION`, `STALE_MARKER`) are unchanged.
  4. Keep `verify` C901 (10) ≤ 15. Put the fork check in a helper.
- **Files**: `src/specify_cli/decisions/verify.py`, `src/specify_cli/cli/commands/decision.py`, `tests/specify_cli/decisions/test_verify_integration.py`.
- **Validation**: R14 is green; an unforked Mission still verifies clean (control).
- **Edge cases**: verify runs in a fresh clone (refs only), and works there because the detector is read-only.

### Subtask T096 – Teardown, consolidation preflight and porcelain-invariant refusals

- **Purpose**: FR-009c, US4.6; research D15 and D12.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Teardown.** In `coordination/teardown.py::teardown_coordination_topology` (L222), at the top, before the projection gate at ≈L283:
     - call `coordination_only_ledger(repo_root, mission_slug)`;
     - when entries or DM files exist only on the coordination side, raise `ProjectionTeardownAbort` (L90) with a new error code `COORDINATION_LEDGER_UNREPAIRED`.
     - The class currently pins `error_code = "PROJECTION_TEARDOWN_ABORTED"` as a class attribute, so add an instance-level override (for example an `error_code` kwarg in `__init__`) without breaking existing callers.
     - The message names the Mission, the coordination branch and the hint `spec-kitty doctor decisions --repair`.
     - This covers every caller: consolidate abort (`cli/commands/consolidate.py` ≈L408), close/discard (`mission_type.py` ≈L1144) and consolidation (`executor.py` ≈L3126). Verify each caller renders `error_code` and the message, and does not swallow it.
  2. **Consolidation preflight.** In `consolidation/executor.py::_pre_mutation_safety_preflight` (L3450), refuse with the same code before any mutation (NFR-001 byte-identical-to-pre-invocation principle stated in its docstring).
  3. **Porcelain invariant.** In `_phase_porcelain_invariant` (L2013; the predicate wiring is at ≈L2033-2041), the residue predicate no longer exempts uncommitted `decisions/` files now that the ledger is PRIMARY (WP12). Make the refusal message name the remedy: commit them with `spec-kitty accept` or `spec-kitty spec-commit … kitty-specs/<dir>/decisions/`. Message-only change; do not alter the predicate.
  4. Edit **only** these three executor sites. IC-18's edits (`_run_lane_based_consolidation` ≈L4181 and `_phase_baseline_and_surface` L825) are WP18's.
- **Files**: `src/specify_cli/coordination/teardown.py`, `src/specify_cli/consolidation/executor.py`, `tests/coordination/test_projection_teardown.py`, `tests/consolidation/test_executor_ledger_preflight.py`.
- **Validation**:
  - R16 (teardown) and the preflight tests are green.
  - `tests/consolidation/test_single_rollback_authority.py` (AST-pinned caller set) and `tests/consolidation/test_coord_teardown_order_3926.py` stay green.
  - A post-fix Mission (ledger PRIMARY) tears down normally (control).
- **Edge cases**:
  - The coordination branch is already deleted: no ledger to protect, so no refusal.
  - `--abort` (consolidate) must refuse too; per CLAUDE.md, rollback restores before clearing the record, so the refusal happens before any teardown.
- **Caller rendering (post-tasks squad P-m1)**: `consolidate.py` (≈L408) and `mission_type.py` (≈L1144) are not owned. Scope to reporting: verify through each CLI entry that the `COORDINATION_LEDGER_UNREPAIRED` message and hint reach the operator via the existing `ProjectionTeardownAbort` rendering. If a caller swallows it, record a follow-up in the activity log instead of editing those files.

## Targeted test surface

- WP tests: `uv run --frozen pytest tests/decisions/test_decisions_reconciler.py tests/decisions/test_decision_fork_detector.py tests/specify_cli/decisions/test_verify_integration.py tests/coordination/test_projection_teardown.py tests/consolidation/test_executor_ledger_preflight.py -q`.
- Owning-module directories (fast tier): `tests/decisions/`, `tests/specify_cli/decisions/`.
- Consolidation guards (named files):
  - `tests/consolidation/test_single_rollback_authority.py`
  - `tests/consolidation/test_rollback_authority.py`
  - `tests/consolidation/test_coord_teardown_order_3926.py`
  - `tests/consolidation/test_issue_4764_terminus_safety.py`
  - `tests/consolidation/test_coord_deleted_degrade_paths.py`
  - `tests/cli/commands/test_merge_status_commit.py`
- Baseline: `make test-fast`.
- Named architectural gates:
  - `tests/architectural/test_merge_reconciliation_class_guard.py`
  - `tests/architectural/test_layer_rules.py`
  - `tests/architectural/test_no_dead_symbols.py` (new public symbols)
- Never run the bare `tests/architectural/`, any e2e or integration directory, performance/stress suites, or `make test-full` (NO_FULL_HEAVY_SUITES_IN_MISSION, C-006).
- Record commands and counts in the activity log. Classify unrelated reds per CLAUDE.md's baseline-red gotcha.
- Post-tasks squad additions (P-m1), each by name, never the directory (the same list as WP18 T102):
  - `tests/consolidation/test_reconciliation.py`, `test_reconciliation_divergent.py`, `test_squash_reconcilers_2709.py`;
  - `tests/consolidation/test_bookkeeping_projection_seam.py`, `test_issue_2709_projection_union.py`, `test_projection_source_status_fallback_2709.py`;
  - `tests/consolidation/test_done_bookkeeping_seam.py`, `test_done_bookkeeping_rollback_coherence.py`;
  - `tests/consolidation/test_canceled_content_residuals.py` (strict xfails stay xfail);
  - `tests/consolidation/test_single_rollback_authority.py`, `test_rollback_authority.py`;
  - `tests/architectural/test_no_worktree_name_guess.py`.

## Quality gates

- C901 ≤ 15 for every touched function (NFR-004). `_diagnose`/`_repair`/`run_decisions_reconciliation` must stay under the ceiling; extract helpers.
- ruff check, ruff format --check, mypy --strict on changed files: 0 issues, no new suppressions (NFR-005). Remove the `ARG001` noqa on `verify` once `mission_slug` is used.
- ≥ 90% coverage of new and changed lines (NFR-003). `fork.py` is core domain logic, so apply higher rigour (tiered standards): table tests for every state.

## Issues

Issues: #5519 #5023

## Definition of Done

- The red-first commit precedes the fixes; R3, R14, R15, R16 and the preflight tests are red at base and green at the end.
- `decisions/fork.py` is the single detector, used by doctor, verify, teardown and preflight; it is read-only.
- Repair never removes an entry with events on either surface; a forked repair exits 1 with reconcile steps; the unforked orphan control is green.
- The coordination-only ledger is reported and copied additively, with no commit.
- Teardown and preflight refuse with `COORDINATION_LEDGER_UNREPAIRED`; the porcelain refusal names accept/spec-commit.
- The NFR-002 zero-loss assertion over the four fixtures is green; quality gates are clean; the activity log is complete.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Detector accidentally materializes** (breaks fresh clones): a test asserts the worktree list is unchanged, and the detector never imports writer APIs.
- **`ProjectionTeardownAbort` error-code change breaks callers**: keep the class default, add an override, and run every caller's test.
- **Executor lane conflict with WP18**: touch only the three named sites, and keep the diff small and local.
- **`verify` signature change ripples**: prefer deriving `repo_root` inside `verify` over changing callers.

## Review Guidance

- The reviewer (opus, distinct from the implementer) verifies red→green. The T090 tests are RED on the WP's base and GREEN on the final commit; the ATDD commit comes first.
- Check fresh-clone behaviour (fixture (c)): no worktree created, fork detected from refs.
- Check no auto-commit in repair, and no re-sequencing (C-003).
- Check the executor diff is confined to `_pre_mutation_safety_preflight` and the porcelain-invariant message.

## Activity Log

> **CRITICAL**: Activity log entries MUST be in chronological order (oldest first, newest last).

### How to Add Activity Log Entries

**When adding an entry**:

1. Scroll to the bottom of this Activity Log section
2. **APPEND the new entry at the END** (do NOT prepend or insert in middle)
3. Use exact format: `- YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ – agent_id – <action>`
4. Timestamp MUST be current time in UTC (check with `date -u "+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"`)
5. Agent ID should identify who made the change (claude-sonnet-4-5, codex, etc.)

**Format**:

```
- YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ – <agent_id> – <brief action description>
```

**Common mistakes (DO NOT DO THIS)**:

- Adding new entry at the top (breaks chronological order)
- Using future timestamps (causes acceptance validation to fail)
- Inserting in middle instead of appending to end

**Initial entry**:

- 2026-10-01T08:36:27Z – system – Prompt created.

### Updating Status

Status is managed via `status.events.jsonl`. Use `spec-kitty agent tasks move-task <WPID> --to <status>` to change WP status.
