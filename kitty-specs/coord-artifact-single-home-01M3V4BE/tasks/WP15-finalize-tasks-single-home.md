# Work Package Prompt: WP15 – finalize-tasks: write location, coordination dirt, per-surface output, planning-commit refresh

## ⚡ Do This First: Load Agent Profile

Use the `/ad-hoc-profile-load` skill to load the agent profile specified in the frontmatter (or any user-defined profile), and behave according to its guidance before parsing the rest of this prompt.

- **Profile**: `python-pedro`
- **Role**: `implementer`
- **Agent/tool**: `claude`

If no profile is specified, run `spec-kitty agent profile list` and select the best match for this work package's `task_type` and `authoritative_surface`.

## Objectives & Success Criteria

`finalize-tasks` must give the coordination-routed Mission's lifecycle records one home and report every surface honestly. It must also keep `planning_commit_sha` current by default. When this WP is done:

- The finalize lifecycle events (`WPCreated`, `TasksCompleted`, the bootstrap writes) are written through `PlacementSeam.write_dir(STATUS_STATE)`. They land in the same coordination log as `move-task`'s events, never in the repository root checkout (US2.2, FR-003).
- Finalize's pre-commit dirtiness check sees COORD-partition records that are dirty **only** on the coordination surface, and commits them on the coordination branch instead of reporting "no changes" (FR-007b, US3.8, R10).
- Text and JSON output report each surface's outcome through WP05's shared renderer. A skipped or refused surface is never masked, and JSON gains `commit_surfaces` beside `commit_hashes` (FR-007, US3.9, R11).
- With no opt-in flag, `planning_commit_sha` is refreshed whenever the PRIMARY planning artefacts changed since it was recorded. It stays unchanged when nothing changed (FR-012, US5.1/5.2, R17).
- A refused **automatic** refresh warns and continues with the old pin (exit 0). An **explicit** `--refresh-planning-commit` refusal still fails, as today (ruling Q6, US5.3). JSON gains `planning_commit_refresh`.

## Context & Constraints

- **Spec**: FR-003 (finalize bootstrap writer family), FR-007, FR-007b, FR-012, FR-016 (R10, R11, R17), SC-003; US2.2, US3.8, US3.9, US5.1-5.3.
- **Plan**: IC-04 (finalize writer rows), IC-07 (finalize consumer rows), IC-09, IC-13. Shared-file map: `mission_finalize.py` is touched by IC-01/04/07/09/13, so all of those finalize edits live in this one WP.
- **Research**: D10 (finalize sees coordination dirt), D8 (consumer table: `mission_finalize.py:3659` fold `_apply_finalize_commit_router_result` L3585; pin refresh L2874), D16 (refresh trigger plus ruling Q6), grounding correction (L2372 is a read inside `_execution_has_begun`, not a writer).
- **Contracts**: `contracts/commit-outcome.md` (JSON additions for finalize-tasks: `commit_surfaces`, `planning_commit_refresh`; exit-code rule), `contracts/write-location-accessor.md`.
- **Upstream WPs you build on**:
  - WP01 extracted helpers from `finalize_tasks` (L4758) and `_ft_apply_writes` (tasks_finalize.py:250); re-read its activity log for the helper names.
  - WP03/WP04 provide `placement_seam(...).write_dir(kind) -> WriteLocation`.
  - WP05 provides `CommitRouterResult.surfaces`, `render_commit_outcome`, `commit_outcome_payload` and the exit-code helper in `src/specify_cli/coordination/commit_outcome.py`.
  - WP02 provides the fixtures in `tests._factories.coord_mission`.
- **Charter**: read `.kittify/charter/charter.md`; load `spec-kitty charter context --action implement`. ATDD-first (C-011): the failing tests are committed before any fix.
- **Model discipline**: implement = sonnet (`claude-sonnet-5`); review = opus.
- **Terminology**: say Mission, never feature. Name the sense of "primary": the **PRIMARY partition** (planning artefacts), the **repository root checkout**, or the **target branch**. Never write bare "primary".
- **C-006**: no heavy suites locally (see Targeted test surface).
- **C-008**: `lanes` and `single_branch` Missions must behave exactly as today.
- **Fixture semantics across lanes (post-tasks squad P-m5):** pre-fix assertions use WP02's `make_prefix_coord_mission`; `make_coord_mission` carries only shape-agnostic invariants (its shape changes when WP06 lands); use `make_coord_mission(..., materialized=True)` when a test needs a deterministic MATERIALIZED coordination surface in every lane.

## Branch Strategy

- **Strategy**: Planning artifacts were generated on issue-5440-coord-artifact-single-home; completed changes must merge back into issue-5440-coord-artifact-single-home.
- **Planning base branch**: issue-5440-coord-artifact-single-home
- **Merge target branch**: issue-5440-coord-artifact-single-home
- `finalize-tasks` allocates execution worktrees per computed lane from `lanes.json`. Start with `spec-kitty agent action implement WP15 --agent claude`, and use the workspace path it resolves; never reconstruct it.
- **Lane-relevant sharing (updated by the post-tasks squad, P-m7)**: the `finalize_tasks` / `_commit_planning_pin_refresh_locked` / `_ft_apply_writes` extraction moved here from WP01 as this WP's tidy-first first commit, so WP01 no longer owns these files. This WP runs in **its own lane**, based on WP05's tip (lane A), which already contains WP01's router and anchor-resolver extractions.

## Subtasks & Detailed Guidance

### Subtask T004 – Extract from `finalize_tasks`, `_commit_planning_pin_refresh_locked` (mission_finalize.py) and `_ft_apply_writes` (tasks_finalize.py)

- **Moved here from WP01 (post-tasks squad P-m7)**: this is this WP's **tidy-first FIRST commit**. It is a behaviour-preserving extraction with its own focused tests and no assertion edits, committed BEFORE the red-first test. Moving it lets this WP take its own lane after WP05 instead of serializing in lane A. Re-measure C901 for the target function(s) first (`ruff check --select C901 <file>`) and record before/after in the activity log.

- **Purpose**: WP15 adds three things to finalize:
  - a default planning-pin refresh, decided in `finalize_tasks` near the `--refresh-planning-commit` option handling (≈L4779-4794);
  - per-surface rendering for the pin-refresh commit (the `commit_for_mission` call inside `_commit_planning_pin_refresh_locked`, ≈L2874);
  - a `write_dir` swap in `_ft_apply_writes` (the `read_dir(STATUS_STATE)` at ≈L444).

  All three functions sit at 14-15 now.
- **Steps**:
  1. `finalize_tasks` (L4758):
     - Extract the option/flag interpretation block, including how `--refresh-planning-commit` / `--allow-orphaned` turn into a refresh decision, into `_resolve_finalize_options(...)` or a similarly named helper. **WP15 adds `planning_changed` there.**
     - Extract the JSON/text result emission into `_emit_finalize_result(...)` if it is inline.
  2. `_commit_planning_pin_refresh_locked` (L2807):
     - Extract the commit-and-interpret step: the `commit_for_mission(..., kind=MissionArtifactKind.LANE_STATE)` call and its result handling, into `_commit_pin_refresh_files(...)`.
     - Extract the `lanes.json` byte-compare guard (`raise RuntimeError("lanes.json changed before the conditional commit; ...")`) into a named guard helper.
     - Preserve compare-and-swap semantics exactly. This is the pin refresh's safety check.
  3. `_ft_apply_writes` (tasks_finalize.py:250): extract the status-event emission leg (the block that resolves the status dir with `read_dir(STATUS_STATE)` near L444 and emits) into `_ft_emit_status_events(...)`. Keep the call order. **WP15 swaps the dir resolution inside this helper**, and WP20's gate will scan whichever function holds that call.
- **Files**:
  - `src/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/mission_finalize.py`
  - `src/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/tasks_finalize.py`
  - new `tests/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/test_finalize_extracted_helpers.py`
- **Validation**:
  - Existing finalize tests stay green unchanged: `tests/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/test_finalize_tasks_commit_surface.py`, `tests/regressions/test_issue_4890_legacy_finalize_effective_graph.py`, plus the finalize-related files under `tests/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/` (use `grep -l finalize`).
  - New tests drive each helper directly: the option resolution matrix (flag × allow-orphaned), the pin-refresh guard raising on changed bytes, and the status-emission helper writing to the dir it was given.
- **Edge cases**:
  - `finalize_tasks` is a Typer command. Do not change option names, defaults, or help text; WP15 owns the help-text change.
  - The pin refresh runs under a lock (the `_locked` suffix). Keep every lock acquisition at its original call depth.

### Subtask T079 – Red-first finalize reproductions (ATDD commit)

- **Purpose**: Pin each finalize defect through the pre-existing CLI entry point (`spec-kitty agent mission finalize-tasks`) before any fix (C-005, FR-016).
- **Steps**:
  1. In `tests/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/test_finalize_tasks_commit_surface.py`, reuse the file's existing finalize fixture conventions first, then add coordination-routed Missions from `tests._factories.coord_mission`, parametrized over `coord` and `lanes_with_coord`.
  2. **R10** `test_finalize_sees_coord_only_lifecycle_dirt`:
     - make finalize's lifecycle records (status log rows, for example `TasksCompleted`) dirty only in the coordination worktree;
     - run finalize;
     - assert the coordination branch tip carries `TasksCompleted`, and the output is not "no changes".
     - Red at base: the porcelain check runs only on the repository root checkout (`_resolve_finalize_commit_candidates`, L3571-3577 region).
  3. **R11 (finalize half)** `test_finalize_reports_skipped_surface`:
     - build a batch where one surface's group is skipped or refused (for example, hold the status lock so the coordination group is refused with `STATUS_LOCK_HELD`);
     - assert the text output and the JSON `commit_surfaces` name that surface.
     - Red at base: `_merge_group_results` masks it.
  4. **R17** `test_finalize_refreshes_planning_commit_sha_by_default`:
     - finalize once;
     - make execution begin (claim WP01, or whatever `_execution_has_begun` at L2325 keys on);
     - commit a planning change (for example an edit to `plan.md` on the target branch);
     - re-run finalize **without** `--refresh-planning-commit`;
     - assert `lanes.json.planning_commit_sha` equals the new planning commit. Red at base: it is unchanged.
  5. Control `test_finalize_keeps_planning_commit_sha_when_unchanged`: the same flow with no planning change; the sha is unchanged. Green at base, and must stay green.
  6. US5.3 `test_finalize_warns_and_keeps_pin_when_auto_refresh_refused`:
     - make the recorded sha not an ancestor of the tip (a rebase or orphaned history), so the advance-only decision refuses;
     - run finalize without the flag;
     - assert exit 0, the old pin kept, a warning naming both commits and `--refresh-planning-commit`, and JSON `planning_commit_refresh.status == "refused"`.
     - Also assert that an explicit `--refresh-planning-commit` in the same fixture still exits non-zero (control for "explicit still fails").
  7. US2.2 `test_finalize_lifecycle_events_share_the_move_task_log`:
     - on a coordination-routed Mission, run finalize, then `move-task WP01 --to claimed`;
     - assert both event kinds sit in the single coordination log with increasing lamport;
     - assert the repository root checkout has no new status rows.
  8. Run the new tests on your base, confirm they are red for the stated reason (not a fixture error), and commit them alone: `test(finalize): red-first reproductions for coordination dirt, masking and planning pin (WP15)`.
- **Files**: `tests/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/test_finalize_tasks_commit_surface.py`.
- **Validation**: record the red outcome for each test in the activity log. The planning-pin control is green.
- **Edge cases**:
  - Finalize may require a valid `tasks.md`/WP set and `lanes.json`; build them via the CLI where possible (`finalize-tasks` itself writes `lanes.json`).
  - US5.3's ancestor break needs a real history rewrite in the throwaway repo; use `git commit --amend` on the recorded planning commit, then force the target ref.
  - Never `xfail` a reproduction.
- **Fixture premise at the lane base (post-tasks squad R-M4)**: this WP's lane base is WP01–WP05; WP06's create seeding is NOT present. Build the coordination-routed fixture with WP02's `make_coord_mission(..., materialized=True)`, or `make_prefix_coord_mission` for a pre-fix leg. Before invoking the CLI, **assert the precondition** the red depends on: the coordination state is MATERIALIZED, the coordination copy of the record is dirty, and the root copy is clean (or whatever the scenario requires). A red then cannot come from a wrong fixture. Do NOT add a dependency on WP06.

### Subtask T080 – Finalize writers use `write_dir(STATUS_STATE)`

- **Purpose**: Close the finalize-bootstrap writer family of FR-003. Today the lifecycle events go to the PRIMARY `planning_dir`, so the log forks.
- **Steps**:
  1. `_emit_local_canonical_events` (`mission_finalize.py:2266`) writes `WPCreated`/`TasksCompleted` into `planning_dir`.
     - Resolve the write directory with `placement_seam(repo_root, mission_slug, owned=...).write_dir(MissionArtifactKind.STATUS_STATE).path` and emit there.
     - Keep `planning_dir` for the PRIMARY-partition reads the function also does, if any.
  2. `tasks_finalize._ft_apply_writes` (`tasks_finalize.py:250`; the `read_dir(STATUS_STATE)` at L444, possibly now inside a WP01-extracted helper): replace the read resolver with `write_dir(STATUS_STATE).path` for the write leg. Keep reads on `read_dir`, and keep `primary_feature_dir` for PRIMARY reads (L141).
  3. Leave `_execution_has_begun` (L2325) alone. Its L2372 is a read.
  4. Thread `owned` through so owned coordination Missions use the owned workspace variant. WP04 handles this in `write_dir`.
  5. Call `write_dir` **before** any reduce of the log, so the seed (if any) lands first (research D2).
  6. Surface the seed: if `WriteLocation.establishment` is `SEEDED` or `RESTORED_FROM_BRANCH`, print the seed summary in the text output and add it to JSON (additive key, for example `coordination_seed`). The accessor already logs at WARNING.
- **Files**: `src/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/mission_finalize.py`, `src/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/tasks_finalize.py`.
- **Validation**:
  - The US2.2 test goes green.
  - On a `lanes`/`single_branch` Mission the events land exactly where they did before (C-008 control; add one if the existing suite lacks it).
  - WP20's gate will scan `mission_finalize.py::_emit_local_canonical_events` and `tasks_finalize.py::_ft_apply_writes` (or the helper that now holds the write), so no read resolver may remain in the write leg.
- **Edge cases**:
  - Remote-only coordination branch: `write_dir` raises `COORDINATION_WORKTREE_UNMATERIALIZED`. Render it as a clean error with the recovery hint, no traceback, and nothing written.
  - Seed fork (`COORD_SEED_FORK_REFUSED`): same rendering.

### Subtask T081 – Pre-commit dirtiness check includes the coordination surface

- **Purpose**: FR-007b. `_resolve_finalize_commit_candidates` (L3542) runs `git status --porcelain` only in the repository root checkout (≈L3569-3577), so coordination-only dirt reads as "no changes".
- **Steps**:
  1. Split the candidates by partition (`kind_for_mission_file`). PRIMARY candidates keep today's root-checkout porcelain.
  2. For the COORD candidates (the status log, the issue and acceptance matrices, and any other COORD kind finalize writes), resolve each owning path via `write_dir(kind).path`. Run `git status --porcelain` in the coordination worktree on those paths.
  3. Follow the precedent of `_refresh_worktree_status_findings` (L2586), which already inspects both surfaces.
  4. `has_relevant_changes = primary_dirty or coord_dirty`. Pass the owning-surface paths to `commit_for_mission`; WP05's router commits coordination-worktree paths in place.
  5. Keep the meta.json attribution logic (`_meta_json_delta_is_finalize_attributable`) exactly as is.
  6. If adding the coordination leg pushes C901 past 15, extract a `_coord_candidate_dirt(...)` helper with focused tests.
- **Files**: `mission_finalize.py`.
- **Validation**:
  - R10 goes green.
  - A Mission with only PRIMARY dirt behaves as before.
  - A Mission with neither dirt reports "no changes" (control).
- **Edge cases**:
  - The coordination worktree is absent at check time. `write_dir` already materialized or refused it in T080, so the order in the flow must be write first, check second.
  - An owned checkout: use the owned path form (`owned.files(...)` at ≈L3654) consistently.

### Subtask T082 – Per-surface finalize output

- **Purpose**: FR-007 and US3.9. Finalize renders every surface through the shared renderer.
- **Steps**:
  1. In `_apply_finalize_commit_router_result` (L3585) and the call site (≈L3659), keep the existing `commit_hashes` (L3599, emitted at L3746). Add `commit_surfaces = commit_outcome_payload(router_result)["surfaces"]` (or the equivalent field of the payload helper) to the outcome dataclass (≈L3528) and to the JSON emit at ≈L3746.
  2. For text output, print the lines from `render_commit_outcome(router_result)`. Do not hand-format.
  3. Planning-pin refresh consumer at ≈L2874-2897 (`_commit_planning_pin_refresh_locked`): render its router result through the same pair, and add its surfaces to the refresh JSON.
  4. Exit code: use the shared exit-code helper. Any `refused`/`error` surface makes finalize exit non-zero; `skipped`/`unchanged` exit 0.
     - Check whether today's finalize already exits non-zero on router `status="error"`, and preserve that.
     - The new non-zero exit for a refused coordination surface is the intended fix.
- **Files**: `mission_finalize.py`.
- **Validation**:
  - R11 (finalize) goes green.
  - JSON stays additive: assert the old keys are still present and typed the same.
  - Run the existing finalize JSON-shape tests.
- **Edge cases**:
  - A PRIMARY-only batch yields one surface entry.
  - A planning-artifact-only Mission yields no coordination entry.

### Subtask T083 – Refresh `planning_commit_sha` by default when planning changed

- **Purpose**: FR-012, US5.1/5.2. The flag's behaviour becomes the default (research D16).
- **Steps**:
  1. In `finalize_tasks` (L4758; options start at L4779), compute `refresh = refresh_planning_commit or planning_changed`.
     - Put the computation in a new helper (for example `_planning_changed_since_pin(repo_root, mission_slug, recorded_sha, target_tip) -> bool`) so `finalize_tasks` stays ≤ 15.
  2. `planning_changed` is true when `git diff --name-only <recorded planning_commit_sha> <target tip> -- <the Mission's PRIMARY planning paths, excluding lanes.json>` is non-empty.
     - Classify each path with `kind_for_mission_file`, keeping only PRIMARY-partition kinds.
     - `lanes.json` is excluded so finalize's own pin commit never re-triggers.
  3. When `refresh` is true, run the existing flow unchanged:
     - `_resolve_refresh_planning_commit_decision` (L2521; advance-only unless `--allow-orphaned`);
     - `_preflight_refresh_planning_commit` (L2682);
     - `_commit_planning_pin_refresh` (L2768) → `_commit_planning_pin_refresh_locked` (L2807).
  4. Follow the existing branches carefully: today `refresh_planning_commit` gates several call paths (≈L4515, L4611, L4939-5026). Keep the explicit flag's path byte-identical; the automatic path reuses it with an `auto=True` marker that only changes the refusal handling (T084).
  5. With no recorded sha (first finalize), there is nothing to refresh; keep today's behaviour.
- **Files**: `mission_finalize.py`.
- **Validation**:
  - R17 is green and the unchanged control is green.
  - Existing explicit-flag tests (#4141, #4827 `--allow-orphaned`) still pass unchanged.
- **Edge cases**:
  - Execution not begun: today's re-finalize may already rewrite the pin. Do not double-commit; reuse whatever path already runs.
  - A target tip equal to the recorded sha means no diff, so no refresh.

### Subtask T084 – Refused automatic refresh warns and continues; JSON field; help text

- **Purpose**: Ruling Q6, US5.3. A refused automatic refresh must never block finalize; an explicit one still fails.
- **Steps**:
  1. When the automatic refresh (not the flag) is refused, catch the refusal. Refusal sources:
     - the advance-only decision refuses without `--allow-orphaned`;
     - the preflight reports a dirty-checkout finding;
     - `_refuse_planning_pin_refresh` is raised inside the flow.
  2. On that refusal:
     - keep the old pin;
     - print a warning naming the recorded commit, the candidate (target tip) commit, and the manual route `spec-kitty agent mission finalize-tasks --refresh-planning-commit` (plus `--allow-orphaned` when the reason is non-ancestry);
     - continue finalize and exit 0.
  3. When the flag was passed explicitly, keep today's failure exactly.
  4. Add JSON `planning_commit_refresh: {"status": "refreshed"|"unchanged"|"refused", "recorded": <sha>, "candidate": <sha>, "reason": <code>}`, always present when a pin is recorded.
  5. Update the `--refresh-planning-commit` help text (L4779-4794): finalize now refreshes automatically when planning artefacts changed; the flag forces a refresh, and an explicit refusal fails.
- **Files**: `mission_finalize.py`.
- **Validation**:
  - The US5.3 test (both legs) is green.
  - Grep the help text in a CLI `--help` snapshot test if one exists, and update it.
- **Edge cases**:
  - Do not swallow unrelated exceptions: catch only the refusal types/exits the refresh flow raises, and give each its own reason code.
  - Make sure the warning goes to stderr/console and not into the JSON stream.

## Targeted test surface

- Red-first and fix tests: `uv run --frozen pytest tests/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/test_finalize_tasks_commit_surface.py -q`.
- Finalize neighbours (named files):
  - `uv run --frozen pytest tests/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/test_finalize_extracted_helpers.py tests/regressions/test_issue_4890_legacy_finalize_effective_graph.py -q`
  - any `tests/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/test_*finalize*.py` and `tests/agent/test_agent_feature.py`.
- Owning-module directory: `tests/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/` (fast tier: `-m "fast or unit"` where marked).
- Baseline: `make test-fast`.
- Named architectural gate files only:
  - `tests/architectural/test_status_events_writes_gate.py`
  - `tests/architectural/test_status_state_read_dir_single_authority.py`
  - `tests/architectural/test_no_write_side_rederivation.py` (pre-extension; WP20 extends it)
- Never run the bare `tests/architectural/`, any e2e or integration directory, performance/stress suites, or `make test-full` (NO_FULL_HEAVY_SUITES_IN_MISSION, C-006). `tests/integration/test_accept_matrix_coord_partition.py` and similar integration files belong to CI.
- Record commands and pass/fail counts in the activity log for the PR's *Tests run* section.
- Classify any red you did not cause using CLAUDE.md's baseline-red gotcha (known P0s, CI-env auth, stale install, stale venv) before chasing it.

## Quality gates

- C901 ≤ 15 for every touched function (NFR-004). `finalize_tasks` was 14 before WP01; add the refresh decision and coordination-dirt checks as new helpers.
- `uv run --frozen ruff check <changed files>`, `uv run --frozen ruff format --check <changed files>`, `uv run --frozen mypy --strict <changed files>`. Zero issues and no new suppressions (NFR-005).
- ≥ 90% coverage of new and changed lines, with a focused test per new helper and branch (NFR-003, diff-cover).
- JSON changes are additive only.

## Issues

Issues: #5513 #5023

## Definition of Done

- T079 tests were committed first and shown red on the base, with reasons recorded; all are green on the final commit.
- No finalize write leg uses a read resolver for a COORD kind.
- Coordination-only dirt is committed on the coordination branch.
- `commit_surfaces` and `planning_commit_refresh` are in JSON, and text renders through `render_commit_outcome`.
- Default refresh works; a refused automatic refresh warns and continues; an explicit refusal fails.
- C-008 controls are green; quality gates are clean; the activity log has commands and counts.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Many entangled flags** (`refresh_planning_commit`, `allow_orphaned`, `validate_only`): add a decision-table test for the refresh trigger and keep the explicit path untouched.
- **Exit-code change** (a refused coordination surface now exits non-zero): this is intended (FR-007). Call it out in the activity log so WP21's e2e expectations match.
- **Write before check ordering**: the seed must run before the porcelain check, or a pre-fix Mission reports "no changes". Covered by R10 on the pre-fix builder.
- **Tidy-first first**: your own T004 extraction is the first commit; build every later change on those helpers and do not re-inline them.

## Review Guidance

- The reviewer (opus, distinct from the implementer) verifies red→green. The T079 tests are RED on the WP's base (before this WP's fix commits) and GREEN on the final commit. Check that the ATDD commit precedes the fix commits.
- Confirm `_emit_local_canonical_events` and the `_ft_apply_writes` write leg use `write_dir`, and that L2372 was left alone.
- Confirm the explicit `--refresh-planning-commit` path is byte-identical in behaviour (existing #4141/#4827 tests unchanged), and the automatic path only differs in refusal handling.
- Confirm no hand-formatted surface output, and the JSON is additive.

## Activity Log

> **CRITICAL**: Activity log entries MUST be in chronological order (oldest first, newest last).

### How to Add Activity Log Entries

**When adding an entry**:

1. Scroll to the bottom of this Activity Log section
2. **APPEND the new entry at the END** (do NOT prepend or insert in middle)
3. Use exact format: `- YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ – agent_id – <action>`
4. Timestamp MUST be current time in UTC (check with `date -u "+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"`)
5. Agent ID should identify who made the change (claude-sonnet-4-5, codex, etc.)

**Format**:

```
- YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ – <agent_id> – <brief action description>
```

**Common mistakes (DO NOT DO THIS)**:

- Adding new entry at the top (breaks chronological order)
- Using future timestamps (causes acceptance validation to fail)
- Inserting in middle instead of appending to end

**Initial entry**:

- 2026-10-01T08:36:27Z – system – Prompt created.

### Updating Status

Status is managed via `status.events.jsonl`. Use `spec-kitty agent tasks move-task <WPID> --to <status>` to change WP status.
