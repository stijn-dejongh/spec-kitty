## Objectives & Success Criteria

Build the **core of the one write-location accessor**: the function that, for a COORD-partition record of a coordination-routed Mission, returns the coordination Mission dir. It returns that in every coordination-worktree state, or refuses loudly. Specifically:

- **Value objects** in a new `src/mission_runtime/write_location.py`: `WriteLocation`, `Establishment`, `SeedReport`.
- **`establish_coord_write_location(...)`** in a new `src/specify_cli/coordination/coord_seed.py`. It does all of the following:
  - materializes an UNMATERIALIZED surface whose branch is local;
  - refuses a remote-only or deleted branch;
  - seeds a pre-fix EMPTY surface;
  - restores a post-fix EMPTY surface from the branch tip, with a loud warning.
- **`seed_coord_surface(...)`**: the one-time carry-over (contracts/seed.md):
  - prefix rule on event-id sequences;
  - fork refusal `COORD_SEED_FORK_REFUSED`;
  - atomic temp-dir + `os.rename` visibility;
  - one seed commit on the coordination branch;
  - root-checkout restoration;
  - idempotent; runs under the status lock.
- **`FeatureStatusLockTimeoutError.error_code = "STATUS_LOCK_HELD"`**.
- A test matrix over every state row, the prefix and fork cases, idempotence, atomicity, root restoration, lock reentrancy and the NFR-002 fixtures.

`PlacementSeam.write_dir(kind)`, the seam method writers call, is **WP04**. This WP exposes `establish_coord_write_location` for WP04 to delegate to.

## Context & Constraints

- **Load the charter**: `.kittify/charter/charter.md` and `spec-kitty charter context --action implement --json`.
- **Spec**:
  - FR-003a (establish or refuse; post-fix EMPTY warns and restores);
  - FR-004, FR-004a, FR-004b (seed exactly once, atomic, fork refusal);
  - US2.3-US2.8;
  - C-001 (one sanctioned seam extension; no new commit mechanism; the seed commits through the existing `commit_for_mission`);
  - C-003 (no automatic log merge);
  - C-004 (fix forward);
  - NFR-002 (zero loss).
- **Plan**: IC-03, including its risks: lock ordering; the owned-checkout arm; remote-only refusal (ruling Q1); post-fix restore (ruling Q3); pre-fix seed commit (ruling Q5).
- **Research**: D1 (accessor shape), D2 (lock ordering, atomicity), D3 (prefix rule, fork refusal), D4 (post-fix vs pre-fix discriminator: the `Spec-Kitty-Coordination-Seed: <mission_id>` trailer, constant `COORD_SEED_TRAILER` owned here; no meta flag; ~~"the coordination branch tree is the fact"~~ struck in round 4), D5 (seed commits on the coordination branch), D20 (remote-only refusal).
- **Contracts**: `contracts/seed.md` (procedure steps 1-11, errors) and `contracts/write-location-accessor.md` (states, errors).
- **Data model**: §2 (WriteLocation, CoordState handling table), §3 (SeedRequest/SeedReport, invariants I-SEED-1..9, outcomes), §7 (atomicity boundaries).
- **Code anchors** (verified at `ecb5dd914a`):
  - `ActionContextError`: `src/mission_runtime/resolution.py:126`.
  - `FeatureStatusLockTimeoutError`: `src/specify_cli/status/locking.py:59`. `feature_status_lock(repo_root, lock_key, *, timeout=-1)` at L278 is keyed on the git common dir plus the Mission dir name (path helper L147) and is reentrant (`machine_file_lock(..., reentrant=True)`, L255).
  - `CoordState`: `missions/_read_path_resolver.py:250-275`; `probe_coord_state` is just below it.
  - `materialize_coord_surface_for_write`: `coordination/surface_resolver.py:903`. It no-ops unless UNMATERIALIZED, raises via `_raise_unmaterialized` (L877) for a remote-only branch, and calls `CoordinationWorkspace.resolve` (`workspace.py:297`) otherwise.
  - `CoordinationBranchDeleted`: `surface_resolver.py:191`; `CoordinationWorktreeUnmaterialized`: `surface_resolver.py:292`.
  - `commit_for_mission(repo_root, mission_slug, files, message, policy, *, kind, ...)`: `coordination/commit_router.py:218`. Coordination-worktree paths commit in place (the `is_under_worktrees_segment` branch, ≈L1026).
  - `kind_for_mission_file`: `mission_runtime/artifacts.py:415`.
- **Layering**: `mission_runtime` must not import `specify_cli` at module level. `write_location.py` therefore holds only types and a stdlib/mission_runtime import set. `SeedReport` lives there because `WriteLocation.seed` references it. Run `tests/architectural/test_layer_rules.py`.
- **Do not edit `surface_resolver.py`** (owned by WP01/WP04). Call its public and private functions as needed; if you must use a private one, note it.
- **Model discipline**: implement = sonnet (`claude-sonnet-5`); review = opus.
- **Terminology**: Mission, never feature. Name the sense: "repository root checkout" (where pre-fix records sit), "target branch", "coordination branch/surface".
- **No heavy suites** (C-006).
- **Brownfield scout (binding read)**: before coding, read `## WP03` in `kitty-specs/coord-artifact-single-home-01M3V4BE/research/brownfield-scout-wp01-11.md` (plus its "Cross-cutting" section where present). Its corrections are folded into the "Binding corrections" section below, which overrides conflicting text above.

## Branch Strategy

- **Strategy**: Planning artifacts were generated on issue-5440-coord-artifact-single-home; completed changes must merge back into issue-5440-coord-artifact-single-home.
- **Planning base branch**: `issue-5440-coord-artifact-single-home`
- **Merge target branch**: `issue-5440-coord-artifact-single-home`
- `finalize-tasks` allocates execution worktrees per computed lane from `lanes.json`.
- Start with `spec-kitty agent action implement WP03 --agent claude` and use the printed workspace path; never reconstruct it.
- **Lane-relevant shared files**: none. This WP runs in its own lane, after WP02 (fixtures). WP04 (lane A) depends on it.

## Subtasks & Detailed Guidance

### Subtask T012 – Red-first tests, value objects, error codes

- **Purpose**: Pin the observable contract before implementing (charter ATDD-First Discipline C-011), and introduce the typed results every writer receives.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Red-first commit (separate, first)**: `tests/coordination/test_coord_seed.py` with WP02 builders:
     - **Through the pre-existing entry point**: on `make_prefix_coord_mission(worktree="empty")`, the existing read resolver `placement_seam(repo_root, slug).read_dir(MissionArtifactKind.STATUS_STATE)` returns the **repository root checkout** dir. That is today's EMPTY fallback, so any writer using it forks the log. Write the test asserting the **write side** instead: `establish_coord_write_location(repo_root, slug, STATUS_STATE, owned=None).path` is the coordination Mission dir and holds the carried log. It fails at the base, because the function and module do not exist.
     - Assert in the same test that `read_dir` still returns the root dir. This is C-002, the kept read fallback, and stays green.
     - Add one failing test per state row (they become green in T016).
  2. `src/mission_runtime/write_location.py` (new):
     ```python
     class Establishment(enum.Enum):
         NONE = "none"; MATERIALIZED = "materialized"; SEEDED = "seeded"; RESTORED_FROM_BRANCH = "restored_from_branch"

     @dataclass(frozen=True)
     class SeedReport:
         carried: tuple[str, ...] = ()
         restored_root: tuple[str, ...] = ()
         restored_from_branch: tuple[str, ...] = ()
         coord_commit: str | None = None
         warnings: tuple[str, ...] = ()

     @dataclass(frozen=True)
     class WriteLocation:
         path: Path
         surface: Literal["primary", "coordination"]
         coord_state_before: CoordState | None
         establishment: Establishment
         seed: SeedReport | None = None
     ```
     `CoordState` lives in `specify_cli.missions._read_path_resolver`. Do not import it at module level from mission_runtime: use `TYPE_CHECKING` plus a string annotation, or type `coord_state_before` as `str | None` holding the enum value. Pick whichever passes `test_layer_rules.py` and `mypy --strict`, and document the choice. Declare `__all__`.
  3. **Error type**: `CoordSeedForkRefused(ActionContextError)`. Place it in `coord_seed.py`, importing `ActionContextError` from the `mission_runtime` **package root** only (MR-1/MR-2; see Binding corrections); construct it with `.code`, not `error_code`. Putting it in `write_location.py` would make that module import `resolution.py`, and `resolution.py` will import `write_location.py` in WP04: a cycle. Give it `error_code = "COORD_SEED_FORK_REFUSED"` and structured attributes: `root_path`, `coord_path`, `coord_ref`, `first_divergence_root`, `first_divergence_coord`, `reconcile_steps`.
  4. `status/locking.py:59`: add the class attribute `error_code: str = "STATUS_LOCK_HELD"` to `FeatureStatusLockTimeoutError`. Additive; the message is unchanged.
- **Files**: `src/mission_runtime/write_location.py`, `src/specify_cli/status/locking.py`, `tests/coordination/test_coord_seed.py`, `tests/mission_runtime/test_write_location.py`.
- **Validation**: the red commit fails for the right reason (missing behaviour, not a fixture error); `tests/mission_runtime/test_write_location.py` covers frozen-ness and defaults; the existing locking tests stay green (`grep -rl FeatureStatusLockTimeoutError tests/`).
- **Edge cases**: `error_code` must not clash with an existing attribute name on the exception. Check how other spec-kitty errors expose codes (for example `StructuredError`) and match that convention.
- **`checkout_root` (post-tasks squad P-M3)**: `WriteLocation` gains `checkout_root: Path`. It is the root of the checkout that holds `path`: the coordination worktree root for `surface="coordination"`, and the repository root checkout for `surface="primary"`. `establish_coord_write_location` populates it, and WP04 populates it for PRIMARY results. WP05, WP07, WP09, WP16 and WP18 consume it instead of deriving `.path.parent.parent`. Add a value-object test.

### Subtask T013 – Prefix rule as pure functions

- **Purpose**: The heart of "carry exactly once, refuse a fork" (I-SEED-4, I-SEED-6; research D3). Keep it pure, so it is exhaustively testable.
- **Steps**:
  1. In `coord_seed.py`:
     - `def read_event_ids(lines: Iterable[str]) -> tuple[str, ...]`: parse JSONL; skip blank lines; a malformed line raises a typed error and never silently skips (zero-loss rule).
     - `@dataclass(frozen=True) class PrefixVerdict`, with `kind: Literal["carry_tail", "nothing", "fork"]`, `tail_start: int` and `first_divergence: tuple[str | None, str | None]`.
     - `def classify_prefix(root_ids, coord_ids) -> PrefixVerdict`:
       - `C` empty → carry_tail(0);
       - `C` a proper prefix of `R` → carry_tail(len(C));
       - `R` a prefix of `C`, or equal → nothing;
       - otherwise fork, recording the first index where they differ.
     - `def merged_log_bytes(root_lines, coord_lines, verdict) -> bytes`: `C` plus the root lines from `tail_start` onward, **byte-faithful** (take the original root lines; never re-serialize).
  2. The streams are `status.events.jsonl` and `decisions.events.jsonl`. Apply the rule per stream; both must pass for the seed to proceed.
- **Files**: `src/specify_cli/coordination/coord_seed.py`; tests in `tests/coordination/test_coord_seed.py`.
- **Validation**:
  - A table-driven matrix: empty/empty, empty/R, C⊂R, R⊂C, equal, diverge at 0, diverge mid, diverge at last.
  - If `hypothesis` is already a dev dependency (check `pyproject.toml`), add a property test: for any `R` and a prefix `C`, `merged == R` and there are no duplicate ids. Otherwise use a seeded random generator.
- **Edge cases**:
  - Duplicate ids inside one input log: refuse (fork-like) rather than "fix" it, and name the duplicate. NFR-002 says no id twice; do not create or propagate duplicates.
  - Trailing newline handling must be byte-faithful.
- **Neutral home, mandatory reuse (post-tasks squad P-M6)**: put the pure prefix/fork classifier in `src/specify_cli/coordination/event_prefix.py` (owned here; tests in `tests/coordination/test_event_prefix.py`). It is pure, takes event-id sequences, and has no git or lock imports. `coord_seed.py` imports it, and WP17's fork detector **must** reuse it (no second classifier). Export a small, typed public API (e.g. `event_ids_of(lines)`, `classify_prefix(root_ids, coord_ids) -> PrefixVerdict`).

### Subtask T014 – `seed_coord_surface`: lock, re-probe, collect, build, rename

- **Purpose**: contracts/seed.md steps 1-8. Readers must never see a partial seed (I-SEED-3), and PRIMARY files are never copied (I-SEED-9).
- **Steps**:
  1. Signature: `seed_coord_surface(request: SeedRequest) -> SeedReport`. `SeedRequest` is a frozen dataclass in `coord_seed.py` with: `repo_root`, `mission_slug`, `mission_dir_name`, `mid8`, `coordination_branch`, `coord_worktree`, `root_mission_dir`, `post_fix: bool`.
  2. **Lock**: `with feature_status_lock(repo_root, mission_dir_name):`. This is reentrant, so a caller already holding it (`BookkeepingTransaction`) does not deadlock. Map `FeatureStatusLockTimeoutError` by letting it propagate (it now carries `STATUS_LOCK_HELD`).
  3. **Re-probe**: `probe_coord_state(...)`. If it is MATERIALIZED, return `SeedReport()` (another writer won; idempotent, I-SEED-6).
  4. **Cleanup**: remove stale `<coord_wt>/kitty-specs/.<dir>.seed-*` dirs (crash leftovers).
  5. **Collect**: walk `root_mission_dir`. Keep a file iff `kind_for_mission_file(<mission-relative path>)` is a COORD-partition kind; use the taxonomy's public partition predicates (`kind_is_coordination_residue(kind, topology)` / `not is_primary_artifact_kind(kind)`, from the `mission_runtime` package root; never the private `_PLACEMENT_ARTIFACT_KINDS`), not a hand list. Expected: `status.events.jsonl`, `status.json`, `decisions.events.jsonl`, `traces/*.md`, `tasks/*/review-cycle-*.md`, `issue-matrix.*`, `acceptance-matrix.json`. **Never** `meta.json`, `spec.md` or other PRIMARY files.
     - Note: WP12 later moves `DECISION_LEDGER` (`decisions/DM-*.md`, `index.json`) to PRIMARY. Rely on the taxonomy, not a list, so the seed follows automatically.
  6. **Coordination side**: the coordination-side content is the branch-tip blobs of **COORD-kind** files only (`git show <coord>:kitty-specs/<dir>/<file>`; list them with `git ls-tree -r --name-only <coord> -- kitty-specs/<dir>/` and classify each). PRIMARY files on the tip (a pre-fix branch cut after the first target commit) are ignored. When there are no COORD-kind blobs, it is empty (contracts/seed.md step 5).
  7. **Logs**: `classify_prefix` per stream. A fork raises `CoordSeedForkRefused` **before writing anything** (state unchanged). The message names both paths, both refs, the first diverging ids, and the reconcile steps from contracts/seed.md errors table:
     - inspect with `spec-kitty doctor decisions`;
     - keep the coordination log;
     - re-open any root-only decisions with `spec-kitty agent decision open ...`;
     - then remove the root copy.
  8. **Non-log records** (I-SEED-5): coordination copy if present, else root copy. When both exist and differ, add a warning; the root is untouched.
  9. **Build**: write the full output tree into `<coord_wt>/kitty-specs/.<dir>.seed-<pid>-<ulid>/`, then `os.rename(temp, <coord_wt>/kitty-specs/<dir>)`. Ensure `<coord_wt>/kitty-specs/` exists first. If the target appears between re-probe and rename, the lock makes that impossible for cooperating writers. Still handle `FileExistsError`/`OSError` by removing the temp dir and re-probing once.
- **Files**: `src/specify_cli/coordination/coord_seed.py`.
- **Validation**: unit tests in T017. Keep each step a separate private function, so every function stays C901 ≤ 15.
- **Edge cases**:
  - **Create-time seed**: nothing to collect, so an empty Mission dir is created. WP06 relies on this; the report has empty `carried`.
  - **Windows**: `os.rename` onto an existing dir fails, which is acceptable because the target must be absent.

### Subtask T015 – Seed commit and repository-root restoration

- **Purpose**: contracts/seed.md steps 9-11; I-SEED-7 (durable), I-SEED-8 (root restoration); research D5 (ruling Q5: one commit on the coordination branch before the triggering write proceeds).
- **Steps**:
  1. After the rename, if anything was carried, call:
     ```python
     result = commit_for_mission(
         repo_root, mission_slug,
         files=tuple(<coord worktree absolute paths of carried files>),
         message=f"chore({mission_slug}): seed coordination surface",
         policy=ProtectionPolicy.resolve(repo_root),
         kind=MissionArtifactKind.STATUS_STATE,
     )
     ```
     The paths are under `.worktrees/`, so the router commits them in place.
  2. `committed` → `coord_commit = result.commit_hash`. Anything else (protected coordination ref, etc.) → **do not roll back the dir** (records are not lost); append a warning naming the reason. The **next seed attempt** re-commits them with the trailer (data-model §7, I-SEED-10).
  3. **Root restoration**, per carried root file:
     - tracked and dirty → `git checkout -- <path>`;
     - untracked → unlink;
     - tracked and clean → untouched (pre-fix history stays: C-004).

     Use `git status --porcelain=v1 -z -- <path>` for the decision. Record `restored_root` (repository-relative paths).
  4. Log the whole `SeedReport` at `WARNING` (contract: callers that do not render it still surface it).
- **Files**: `src/specify_cli/coordination/coord_seed.py`.
- **Validation**: tests assert:
  - exactly one new commit on the coordination branch, whose tree carries the log;
  - the target branch did not move;
  - the root copy is back to `HEAD` (dirty case) or gone (untracked case);
  - `restored_root` lists them.
- **Edge cases**:
  - The commit runs inside the status lock, and `commit_for_mission` takes coordination status locks itself (`_coord_status_locks`, ≈L586). The lock is reentrant on the same key; add a test that proves no deadlock.
  - If WP05 has not landed yet in your lane, the router still commits in-place coordination paths today. Do not depend on WP05 behaviour.
- **Trailer (round 4, `plan.design.seed-trailer-ownership`)**: the seed commit carries `Spec-Kitty-Coordination-Seed: <mission_id>`, built from the shared constant `COORD_SEED_TRAILER` defined in this WP's `coord_seed.py`.
- **Refused seed commit, retried**: if the commit is refused, the Mission dir stays, uncommitted (warning). The **next seed attempt** re-commits with the trailer: on the next COORD write, `establish_coord_write_location` detects a pending seed and retries the commit before the triggering write. The predicate is narrowed (round 5, X1; data-model I-SEED-10): **no trailer for this `mission_id` AND no COORD-kind blob under the Mission dir at the coordination tip**, i.e. the dir is wholly untracked. ~~"dir present + uncommitted COORD records + no trailer"~~ is struck, because it also matched never-seeded pre-fix MATERIALIZED Missions. Keep it cheap: the fast path is `git status --porcelain -- kitty-specs/<dir>` reporting `?? kitty-specs/<dir>/`; only then probe the trailer and the tip. Do **not** change the commit router.
- Tests: the refused-then-retried path (first attempt refused, then the ref is unprotected, so the next write commits the seed with the trailer), and the trailer present after a normal seed.

### Subtask T016 – `establish_coord_write_location`: the state machine

- **Purpose**: The single answer to "where does a COORD write go" (data-model §2 table; contracts/write-location-accessor.md).
- **Steps**:
  1. Signature: `establish_coord_write_location(repo_root: Path, mission_slug: str, kind: MissionArtifactKind, *, owned: OwnedCheckout | None) -> WriteLocation`.
  2. Read `meta.json` from the PRIMARY partition (`read_primary_meta`, as `materialize_coord_surface_for_write` does). Resolve `mid8` and `coordination_branch`. No coordination branch → `WriteLocation(path=<primary dir>, surface="primary", coord_state_before=None, establishment=NONE)`.
  3. `state = probe_coord_state(...)`, then dispatch to one small handler per state:
     - **MATERIALIZED**: return the coordination Mission dir, establishment `NONE`. No side effects **unless a seed commit is pending** (round 5, X1; I-SEED-10: no trailer and no COORD-kind blob under the Mission dir at the coordination tip). In that case, re-commit the seed with the trailer first.
     - **UNMATERIALIZED**: call `materialize_coord_surface_for_write(repo_root, mission_slug)`. It raises `CoordinationWorktreeUnmaterialized` for a remote-only branch (#4970 parity, ruling Q1); let that propagate, because nothing has been written. Re-probe, then continue with the MATERIALIZED or EMPTY handler. Establishment is `MATERIALIZED` unless a seed follows.
     - **DELETED**: raise `CoordinationBranchDeleted`, with the recovery hint the existing exception carries.
     - **EMPTY, no `Spec-Kitty-Coordination-Seed: <mission_id>` trailer in the coordination branch history** (pre-fix, including a branch whose tree carries PRIMARY files; round 4, D4): `seed_coord_surface(post_fix=False)` → `SEEDED`.
     - **EMPTY, the trailer is present** (post-fix regression, D4, ruling Q3; ~~"branch tree carries the Mission dir"~~ struck in round 4):
       1. `logger.warning` loudly (Mission, branch, "coordination Mission dir missing from worktree; restoring from branch tip");
       2. restore **COORD-kind paths only** from the branch tip, using an explicit pathspec built from `kind_for_mission_file` over `git ls-tree -r <coord> kitty-specs/<dir>/` (~~whole-dir `git checkout HEAD -- kitty-specs/<dir>`~~ struck in round 3);
       3. if root-only COORD records exist, `seed_coord_surface(post_fix=True)` for them;
       4. return `RESTORED_FROM_BRANCH` with `restored_from_branch` filled.
  4. **Lock order** (I-SEED-2): materialization takes the workspace lock and releases it **before** the seed takes the status lock. Never acquire the status lock and then call `CoordinationWorkspace.resolve` from inside this function, **except** when the caller already holds the status lock. That nesting is the existing `BookkeepingTransaction.acquire` order (`transaction.py:292` then `:465`), and `workspace.py` never takes the status lock.
  5. **Owned checkout** (`owned is not None`): resolve the owned coordination workspace (the owned variant `runtime_bridge.py:363` uses). On failure raise `OWNED_COORDINATION_WORKSPACE_UNAVAILABLE` (existing `OwnedRefusalCode`).
  6. Every error message names the Mission, the coordination branch and a recovery command.
- **Files**: `src/specify_cli/coordination/coord_seed.py`.
- **Validation**: T017 matrix.
- **Edge cases**:
  - The path of a COORD kind must **exist** on return (contract postcondition).
  - PRIMARY-partition kinds are handled by WP04 before delegating. Still, defensively return the primary location for a PRIMARY kind (establishment NONE), and test it.

### Subtask T017 – Test matrix completion

- **Purpose**: Prove every row and invariant (NFR-002, SC-002 groundwork).
- **Steps**: in `tests/coordination/test_coord_seed.py`, using `tests._factories.coord_mission`:
  1. **State rows** (both `coord` and `lanes_with_coord`):
     - MATERIALIZED returns with no git change (`git rev-parse` of every ref unchanged; no new files);
     - UNMATERIALIZED-local → materialized, and the worktree exists;
     - remote-only → `CoordinationWorktreeUnmaterialized`, nothing written;
     - DELETED → `CoordinationBranchDeleted`;
     - pre-fix EMPTY → SEEDED;
     - post-fix EMPTY (delete the dir in the worktree after a seed) → loud warning (`caplog`) and RESTORED_FROM_BRANCH.
  2. **Prefix and fork**: `make_fork_fixture("root_uncommitted_coord_untracked")` → refused; both files are byte-identical before and after; the error carries both paths and the ids.
  3. **Idempotence**: a second call → no new commit, `carried` empty, no event id twice (`event_ids` helper).
  4. **Atomicity**: monkeypatch `os.rename` to raise once. Only `.seed-*` remains and the state is still EMPTY; the next call cleans it and seeds.
  5. **Root restoration**: dirty-tracked and untracked variants.
  6. **Lock reentrancy**: call `establish_coord_write_location` inside `with feature_status_lock(repo_root, dir_name):`. It completes, with no deadlock (use a timeout guard).
  7. **NFR-002**: across fixtures (a)-(d), the count of status events and decision index entries is never reduced by any call.
  8. **C-008 controls**: `lanes` and `single_branch` Missions → primary location, establishment NONE, no side effects.
- **Files**: `tests/coordination/test_coord_seed.py`, `tests/mission_runtime/test_write_location.py`.
- **Validation**: all green; diff coverage ≥ 90% on `coord_seed.py` and `write_location.py`.
- **Edge cases**: tests must not depend on create's current status-log placement. Use the explicit pre-fix builder.
- **Negative test (round 5, X1)**: a pre-fix MATERIALIZED Mission (the #5519 shape: COORD records already committed on the coordination branch, no trailer) with an extra **uncommitted** COORD record in its coordination Mission dir. A COORD write must make **no seed commit and add no trailer**; only the triggering write's own commit happens. This proves the pending-seed predicate does not over-match.
- **MATERIALIZED stays side-effect-free** apart from a pending seed: assert that a normal post-fix MATERIALIZED write makes no extra commit.

## Binding corrections — analyze + brownfield scout (round 3)

> These corrections are binding and **override any conflicting text earlier in this prompt**. Source: `analysis-report.md` and the brownfield scout notes (pointer in Context & Constraints). Operator decisions are quoted where they apply.

- **BLOCKING: package-root imports only.** MR-1/MR-2 (`tests/architectural/test_mission_runtime_surface.py::test_no_external_submodule_imports` :244, `::test_ast_scan_no_external_internal_imports` :342) forbid any `src/` module outside `mission_runtime` from importing a `mission_runtime` submodule, lazy imports included.
  - Re-export `WriteLocation`, `Establishment` and `SeedReport` from `src/mission_runtime/__init__.py` (re-export plus `__all__`), and update `_PUBLIC_SURFACE` in `test_mission_runtime_surface.py:50` (strict ordered equality). Both files are now owned by this WP.
  - `coord_seed.py` imports from the package root only.
  - `CoordState` is a `TYPE_CHECKING`-only import in `write_location.py`, so `test_package_root_cold_imports` (:223) stays cold.
  - This supersedes the T014 phrase "specify_cli may import `mission_runtime.resolution`".
- **Error codes**: `ActionContextError(code, message)` stores **`.code`**, not `error_code` (`resolution.py:126-135`). Construct `CoordSeedForkRefused` with `super().__init__("COORD_SEED_FORK_REFUSED", msg)`. Consumers branch on `.code` (`write_seam.py:312`, `next_cmd.py:873`).
  - Adding `error_code="STATUS_LOCK_HELD"` to `FeatureStatusLockTimeoutError` changes generic `getattr(err, "error_code")` renderers: owned mark-status goes from `MARK_STATUS_FAILED` to `STATUS_LOCK_HELD` (`tasks_mark_status.py:573`), and `next_cmd.py:873` changes too. Declare this in the PR body.
- **Partition predicate**: use the root-exported `kind_is_coordination_residue(kind, topology)` or `not is_primary_artifact_kind(kind)`, and filter `kind_for_mission_file(...) is None` explicitly. Never import `_PLACEMENT_ARTIFACT_KINDS`. Until WP12 lands, `DECISION_LEDGER` is COORD, so the seed copies `decisions/` ledger files. This is a cross-lane timing note; do not special-case it.
- **SINGLE WRITE AUTHORITY (operator decision; scout X1)**: this WP now owns `src/mission_runtime/write_target_degrade.py`.
  - `assert_coord_write_materialized` (L157) becomes a **thin delegate** to `establish_coord_write_location` (lazy import over the existing `coordination` edge):
    - UNMATERIALIZED with a local head → materialize and seed instead of refusing `COORD_WRITE_SURFACE_UNMATERIALIZED`;
    - remote-only still refuses (#4970);
    - DELETED still refuses.
  - **Red-first**: through `coordination/write_seam.write_artifact` (or `resolve_write_target_or_degrade(terminus_write=True)`) on UNMATERIALIZED with a local head whose branch carries the kind, expect materialization. It is red at the base (refusal).
  - **Re-pin deliberately** (owned): `tests/mission_runtime/test_write_target_degrade_selfmat.py` and `tests/specify_cli/cli/commands/test_coordination_remedy_5113.py`. Keep the remote-only refusal pins.
  - This also gives `coord_seed.py` a production caller in this WP, so `tests/architectural/test_no_dead_modules.py` stays **green** (zero-red sequencing; the transitional-red protocol is not needed here).
  - After this WP, WP08, WP09 and WP10 never hit the old refusal.
- **Locks (operator decision; scout X6)**:
  - the lock root is `owned.owned_root if owned else repo_root` (`transaction.py:290-291`);
  - the key is `coord_mission_dir_name(slug, mid8)`, equal to `coord_feature_dir.name`, matching `coord_status_lock` (`status_transition.py:421-423`) and `commit_router._coord_status_locks` (:586);
  - use a **bounded timeout** `BOUNDED_STATUS_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`. `feature_status_lock`'s default `timeout=-1` (`locking.py:278`) makes `STATUS_LOCK_HELD` unreachable.
- **Seed commit**: use policy `ProtectionPolicy.resolve_for_mission(repo_root, slug)` (`git/protection_policy.py:249`), or `resolve_for_owned` (:203) plus `owned=`. Map every non-`committed` `CommitRouterResult.status` (`unchanged`, `no_op_wrong_surface`, `error`) into `SeedReport`.
- **U1 (analyze): refused seed commit.** On a protected coordination ref:
  - the Mission dir stays, uncommitted (no records lost);
  - `SeedReport.warnings` names the refusal;
  - a WARNING log names the Mission, the state and the action;
  - the triggering write proceeds, and the **next seed attempt** (the next COORD write, pending-seed predicate I-SEED-10) re-commits it with the trailer.
  - Test it in `tests/coordination/test_coord_seed.py`.
- **Restore over-reach (operator decision)**: restore **COORD-kind paths only**, using a pathspec built from kind classification. Never `git checkout HEAD -- kitty-specs/<dir>` for the whole dir: a branch cut or fast-forwarded after a target commit carries `meta.json`/`spec.md` (I-SEED-9).
- **D4 discriminator (operator decision)**: "the coordination branch tree carries `kitty-specs/<dir>`" over-matches pre-fix Missions whose coordination branch was cut after the first target commit (fixture `tests/coordination/test_surface_resolver_solo_coord_primary.py:107-146`).
  - The discriminator is the **`Spec-Kitty-Coordination-Seed: <mission_id>` commit trailer** (research D4; Decision Moment `plan.design.seed-trailer-ownership`).
    - Define it once, as the constant `COORD_SEED_TRAILER` in `coord_seed.py` (owned here). WP06 T031 imports it for create's commit.
    - A Mission is post-fix iff its coordination branch history carries the trailer with its `mission_id`.
    - ~~The tree-content alternative ("the branch tree carries a COORD-kind file")~~ is removed.
  - Add a **negative test** with that fixture shape: pre-fix → SEEDED, never RESTORED_FROM_BRANCH, and no loud warning.
  - WP04 reuses it.
- **Value objects**:
  - use `@dataclass(frozen=True, kw_only=True)`, because adding `checkout_root` after a defaulted field is a `TypeError`;
  - prefer the `TopologySurface` enum over `Literal` strings for `surface`;
  - avoid the `Establishment.MATERIALIZED` vs `CoordState.MATERIALIZED` name collision (e.g. `WORKTREE_MATERIALIZED`).
  - Decide and record (tracer `design-decisions`).
- **Paths and portability**:
  - compose temp and target paths from `coord_feature_dir(...)` (`_read_path_resolver.py:218`);
  - `os.rename` onto an existing dir raises on Windows;
  - normalise `git status --porcelain=v1 -z` paths before comparing with `Path`.
- **Owned arm**: `_resolve_owned_coordination_workspace` is private in `runtime/next/runtime_bridge.py:417`; import it lazily and do not relocate it. The owned coordination dir composes from `owned.repository_root` (`resolution.py:1290`), not from `owned_root`.
- **Cold import**: keep `coord_seed` module-level imports light; `decisions.*` is on the charter cold-import path.
- **Gate citation fix (operator decision)**: `test_no_worktree_name_guess.py` explicitly **excludes** `.parent.parent` (L474-476, deferred #2007), so it is **not** the P-M3 guard. P-M3 (`checkout_root`, never `.path.parent.parent`) is enforced mechanically by WP20's extension of `test_no_write_side_rederivation.py`; until then review checks it.
- **"Loud" (analyze A2)** means a WARNING-level log line naming the Mission, the coordination state and the action taken.
- Valid guards to keep green: `tests/coordination/test_materialize_coord_surface.py`, `test_unmaterialized_remedy_text.py`, `tests/specify_cli/coordination/test_coord_topology_states.py`, `test_coord_branch_remote_probe_4979.py`, `tests/status/test_locking_key.py`, `test_locking_reentrancy_migration.py`. Also run `tests/architectural/test_mission_runtime_surface.py`, `test_no_dead_modules.py`, `test_no_dead_symbols.py` and `test_cold_import_status_boundary.py` by name.
- **I10 (round 4)**: the single write authority implements **research D22**. The seed trailer and its COORD-only restore implement **D4** (rev 5).

## Targeted test surface

- Baseline: `make test-fast`.
- This WP:
  ```bash
  uv run --frozen pytest tests/coordination/test_coord_seed.py tests/mission_runtime/test_write_location.py -q
  uv run --frozen pytest tests/coordination/test_materialize_coord_surface.py tests/coordination/test_unmaterialized_remedy_text.py tests/specify_cli/coordination/test_coord_topology_states.py tests/specify_cli/coordination/test_coord_branch_remote_probe_4979.py -q
  uv run --frozen pytest $(grep -rl "FeatureStatusLockTimeoutError\|feature_status_lock" tests --include="test_*.py" | grep -v architectural) -q
  ```
- Named architectural gate files: `tests/architectural/test_layer_rules.py` (mission_runtime must not grow its outbound ledger), `tests/architectural/test_no_dead_symbols.py` (new public symbols must have callers; WP04 adds the caller, so declare `__all__` and keep public names minimal).
- Never run the bare `tests/architectural/`, any e2e/integration directory, performance/stress suites or `make test-full` (NO_FULL_HEAVY_SUITES_IN_MISSION, C-006).
- Record commands and counts in the Activity Log. Classify unrelated reds with the CLAUDE.md baseline-red gotcha.
- Named architectural gates (round 3): `uv run --frozen pytest tests/architectural/test_mission_runtime_surface.py tests/architectural/test_no_dead_modules.py tests/architectural/test_no_dead_symbols.py tests/architectural/test_cold_import_status_boundary.py -q` (`test_no_worktree_name_guess.py` is not the P-M3 guard; see Binding corrections).
- New file: `uv run --frozen pytest tests/coordination/test_event_prefix.py -q`.

## Quality gates

- C901 ≤ 15 per function (NFR-004). One handler per state; the seed steps are separate helpers.
- `ruff check`, `ruff format --check` and `mypy --strict` are clean on changed files (NFR-005), with no new suppressions.
- ≥ 90% coverage of new lines, and a focused test for every branch, including error branches (NFR-003).
- New public symbols: `tests/architectural/test_no_dead_symbols.py`. If it flags `establish_coord_write_location` as callerless until WP04, record that in the Activity Log and coordinate (WP04 is the immediate dependent); do not add a fake caller.
- **Mission tracer files (analyze C4; charter Standing Order 3)**: at every decision point and every friction, append a dated entry through the canonical CLI, e.g. `spec-kitty agent tracer-append --mission coord-artifact-single-home-01M3V4BE --category design-decisions|approach|tooling-friction --entry "<YYYY-MM-DD WPxx: …>" --actor <you>`. The files are `traces/tooling-friction.md`, `traces/approach.md` and `traces/design-decisions.md`.
- **Pre-existing Failure Reporting Rule (analyze C4; charter)**: a red you did not cause and that is red on your base MUST be reported. Record the test id, the exact command and the evidence (output, base SHA) in the activity log and notify the orchestrator, who files the GitHub issue. Never fix it silently, never green-wash it, never xfail it.

## Issues

Issues: #5519 #2533

## Definition of Done

- `write_location.py` (types) and `coord_seed.py` (prefix rule, seed, establish) exist, are typed and are documented.
- `FeatureStatusLockTimeoutError.error_code == "STATUS_LOCK_HELD"`.
- The red-first commit precedes the implementation commits. Every state row, prefix/fork, idempotence, atomicity, restoration, reentrancy, NFR-002 and C-008 test is green.
- No PRIMARY file is ever written to the coordination Mission dir. A fork leaves both surfaces untouched.
- Static gates are clean; layer rules are green.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Deadlock between the status lock and the workspace lock.** Mitigation: the I-SEED-2 order, plus an explicit reentrancy test with a timeout.
- **Partial seed visible to readers.** Mitigation: temp dir plus a single rename, and a crash-simulation test.
- **Silent data loss on a malformed log line.** Mitigation: parse errors refuse; nothing is skipped.
- **Import cycle mission_runtime ↔ specify_cli.** Mitigation: types-only `write_location.py`, the error class in `coord_seed.py`, and a lazy import in WP04.
- **Seed commit refused** (protected coordination ref). Mitigation: the dir stays and a warning is reported (data-model §7); a test covers it.

## Review Guidance

- Reviewer: opus, distinct from the implementer.
- Verify red→green: the red-first tests (T012) are RED on the WP's base (lane base before the fix commits: missing module/behaviour, and the write-side assertion fails) and GREEN on the final commit.
- Check specifically:
  - fork refusal writes nothing;
  - the prefix rule is byte-faithful;
  - lock order;
  - `read_dir` still falls back for reads (C-002);
  - the seed commit lands on the coordination branch only, and the target ref is unchanged;
  - root restoration never rewrites committed history (C-004).

## Activity Log

> **CRITICAL**: Activity log entries MUST be in chronological order (oldest first, newest last).

### How to Add Activity Log Entries

**When adding an entry**:

1. Scroll to the bottom of this Activity Log section
2. **APPEND the new entry at the END** (do NOT prepend or insert in middle)
3. Use exact format: `- YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ – agent_id – <action>`
4. Timestamp MUST be current time in UTC (check with `date -u "+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"`)
5. Agent ID should identify who made the change (claude-sonnet-4-5, codex, etc.)

**Format**:

```
- YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ – <agent_id> – <brief action description>
```

**Common mistakes (DO NOT DO THIS)**:

- Adding new entry at the top (breaks chronological order)
- Using future timestamps (causes acceptance validation to fail)
- Inserting in middle instead of appending to end

**Why this matters**: The acceptance system reads the LAST activity log entry as the current state. If entries are out of order, acceptance will fail even when the work is complete.

**Initial entry**:

- 2026-10-01T08:36:27Z – system – Prompt created.

### Updating Status

Status is managed via `status.events.jsonl`. Use `spec-kitty agent tasks move-task <WPID> --to <status>` to change WP status.
