## Objectives & Success Criteria

Migrate the three **stage-and-copy writers** that go through the shared write seam (`coordination/write_seam.write_artifact`) to write COORD-partition records **in place** at `PlacementSeam.write_dir(kind)`. The three writers are the tracer, the issue matrix and the acceptance matrix. Then carry and render the per-surface commit outcome through the seam's result.

Done means:

- On a coordination-routed Mission, the following write directly into the coordination worktree's Mission dir and commit there:
  - a tracer append (`spec-kitty agent tracer-append` / `append_tracer_finding`): `traces/<file>.md`;
  - an issue-matrix scaffold or update: `issue-matrix.json`;
  - an acceptance-matrix write (`spec-kitty agent ... acceptance verdict` path → `write_and_commit_acceptance_matrix`): `acceptance-matrix.json`.

  The repository root checkout keeps **no** copy or residue (spec edge case "Transient staging").
- `WriteSeamResult` carries `surfaces` (and stops dropping `commit_hashes` / `reason`). The three consumer sites render through WP05's `render_commit_outcome` / `commit_outcome_payload`: `tracer_writer.py` ≈L298, `issue_matrix.py` ≈L404, `acceptance/matrix.py` ≈L524. A skipped or refused surface is visible to callers (FR-007, SC-003).
- A refused write (unroutable, remote-only, DELETED, fork) still touches no disk: the #3073 zero-residue `stage=` thunk property is preserved.
- `lanes` / `single_branch` behave as before (C-008).

## Context & Constraints

- **Spec**: FR-003 (families "tracer", "the issue and acceptance matrices"), FR-007 (consumers "the write seam and its callers: the tracer, the issue and acceptance matrices, and accept's coordination residuals"; accept's residuals move off the seam in WP16), SC-003, edge case "Transient staging", US2.1 (tracer entry in the same lifecycle).
- **Plan**: IC-04 (rows Tracer, Issue matrix, Acceptance matrix), IC-07 (write seam wrapper and its callers).
- **Research**: D1, D8 (consumer table: write seam `write_seam.py:548` "drops hashes/reason"; matrix ≈:524, issue matrix ≈:404, tracer ≈:298; "Discarded-result sites render a warning only when a surface is not committed/unchanged"; exit-code rule).
- **Contracts**: `contracts/commit-outcome.md`, `contracts/write-location-accessor.md`.
- **Verified code facts (at ecb5dd914a)**:
  - `write_seam.py`: `WriteSeamResult` at L215 (fields `status`, `entry_id`, `destination_surface`, `commit_hash`, `diagnostic`); `write_artifact` at L460. It probes routability first, invokes the `stage=` thunk only after the probe succeeds, then calls `commit_for_mission` (≈L548) and builds the result from `status`/`placement_ref`/`commit_hash`/`diagnostic` only.
  - `tracer_writer.py`: `_local_staging_path` at L199 uses `candidate_feature_dir_for_mission` (L213), a read resolver, so the trace is staged in the repository root checkout and copied by the router. The `_stage` thunk + `write_artifact(... kind=TRACER_FILE, primary_paths_created_this_invocation=frozenset({local_path}))` is at ≈L285-310. `append_tracer_finding` is at L227. The CLI is `spec-kitty agent tracer-append` (`cli/commands/agent/__init__.py:33`).
  - `issue_matrix.py`: `scaffold_issue_matrix` at L448. Its dir comes from `coord_read_dir_for(...) or feature_dir` (≈L505), or `placement_seam(...).read_dir(ISSUE_MATRIX)` for owned (≈L503). `write_issue_matrix` → `write_artifact` at ≈L393-415.
  - `acceptance_verdict.py`: `_matrix_read_dir` at L87 uses `placement_seam(...).read_dir(ACCEPTANCE_MATRIX)`. `acceptance/matrix.py`: `write_acceptance_matrix` L449 (raw writer, byte-identical for many fixtures), `write_and_commit_acceptance_matrix` L469 (seam call ≈L524), `read_acceptance_matrix` L537.
- **Upstream**: WP05 (`CommitRouterResult.surfaces`, `commit_outcome.py`), WP03/WP04 (accessor), WP02 (fixtures).
- Load the charter and `spec-kitty charter context --action implement --json`.
- **Model discipline**: implement with sonnet (`claude-sonnet-5`); review with opus.
- **Terminology**: "Mission", never "feature". Name each sense of "primary".
- **Fixture semantics across lanes (post-tasks squad P-m5):** pre-fix assertions use WP02's `make_prefix_coord_mission`; `make_coord_mission` carries only shape-agnostic invariants (its shape changes when WP06 lands); use `make_coord_mission(..., materialized=True)` when a test needs a deterministic MATERIALIZED coordination surface in every lane.

## Branch Strategy

- **Strategy**: Planning artifacts were generated on issue-5440-coord-artifact-single-home; completed changes must merge back into issue-5440-coord-artifact-single-home.
- **Planning base branch**: issue-5440-coord-artifact-single-home
- **Merge target branch**: issue-5440-coord-artifact-single-home
- `finalize-tasks` allocates execution worktrees per computed lane from `lanes.json`. Start with `spec-kitty agent action implement WP10 --agent claude`, and use the printed workspace path.
- **Lane notes**: this WP's ownership is disjoint, so it gets its own lane, based on WP05's tip (lane A). It runs in parallel with WP07/WP09. WP16 (accept) changes accept's residual leg to call the router directly, so do not edit `cli/commands/accept.py` here.

> These fields are populated automatically by `spec-kitty agent mission finalize-tasks`.
> Do NOT change them manually unless you are certain the branch topology has changed.

## Subtasks & Detailed Guidance

### Subtask T053 – Red-first: in-place writes with no root residue, unmasked seam outcomes

- **Purpose**: Pin the contract through the pre-existing entry points first (ATDD-First, C-005). Commit separately, before any fix.
- **Steps**:
  1. `tests/retrospective/test_tracer_writer_write_dir.py`: on a coordination Mission (WP02 `make_coord_mission`, parametrized `coord`/`lanes_with_coord`, plus `make_prefix_coord_mission(worktree="empty")`), run `spec-kitty agent tracer-append ...` (check its options in `cli/commands/agent/tracer_append.py`) or `append_tracer_finding(...)`. Assert:
     - the coordination branch tip carries `kitty-specs/<dir>/traces/<file>.md` with the entry;
     - the file exists in the coordination worktree;
     - the repository root checkout has NO `traces/<file>.md` change (`git status --porcelain -- kitty-specs/<dir>` empty) and no untracked copy;
     - for the pre-fix EMPTY variant, the status log was seeded once before the tracer commit (one seed commit on the coordination branch).
  2. `tests/tasks/test_issue_matrix_write_dir.py`: the same for `scaffold_issue_matrix` / `write_issue_matrix` (a spec.md that references `#123`).
  3. `tests/acceptance/test_acceptance_matrix_write_dir.py`: the same for the acceptance-verdict path (`acceptance_verdict.py` command, or `write_and_commit_acceptance_matrix` with the dir from `_matrix_read_dir`).
  4. `tests/coordination/test_write_seam_surfaces.py`: `write_artifact` with a monkeypatched `commit_for_mission` returning a `CommitRouterResult` whose `surfaces` has one committed and one refused (`STATUS_LOCK_HELD`). Assert `WriteSeamResult.surfaces` carries both, and `commit_hashes` / `reason` are present (red at base: dropped).
  5. Run on the lane base. Expected RED: root staging residue or root-located writes, and dropped surfaces. Record the output.
- **Edge cases**: at base, the tracer stages in root and the router copies into the coordination worktree. The coordination tip assertion may already pass, while the residue assertion is the red one. That is fine and expected: say so in the log.

### Subtask T054 – `WriteSeamResult.surfaces` passthrough

- **Purpose**: The write seam is a wrapper consumer. Masking at the wrapper hides refusals from every caller (FR-007).
- **Steps**:
  1. Add `surfaces: tuple[SurfaceOutcome, ...] = ()`, `commit_hashes: tuple[str, ...] = ()` and `reason: str | None = None` to `WriteSeamResult` (frozen dataclass, additive, defaults last; check whether it is frozen/slots and keep that).
  2. In `write_artifact` (≈L548-575) populate them from the `CommitRouterResult`. For the zero-write `"refused"` outcome (no router call), leave `surfaces=()` and keep `status="refused"`. For the post-consolidation direct path (`_commit_post_consolidation_write`), build one `SurfaceOutcome` for the destination it commits to, so consumers render uniformly.
  3. Update the docstring (`status` semantics unchanged; `surfaces` is the per-surface truth).
- **Files**: `src/specify_cli/coordination/write_seam.py`.
- **Validation**: T053 seam test green; `tests/coordination/test_write_seam_adoption.py` green.

### Subtask T055 – Tracer writes in place at `write_dir(TRACER_FILE)`

- **Purpose**: `_local_staging_path` (L199-213) stages the trace in the repository root checkout via `candidate_feature_dir_for_mission`. That is the stage-in-root-then-copy pattern the single-home rule forbids. It is also in WP20's census (`retrospective/tracer_writer.py::_local_staging_path`).
- **Steps**:
  1. Change `_local_staging_path` to resolve `placement_seam(repo_root, mission_slug).write_dir(MissionArtifactKind.TRACER_FILE).path / "traces" / filename` (mirror the existing relative layout). Keep the name if you can, so WP20's census qualname stays valid. If you rename it, record the new qualname in the Activity Log.
  2. **Preserve the zero-residue property.** `write_dir` can materialize and seed (side effects). Today `local_path` is computed eagerly (≈L285), before `write_artifact`'s routability probe. Move the `write_dir` call **inside** the `_stage` thunk so a refused write (probe fails) triggers no materialization or seed. Compute `primary_paths_created_this_invocation` accordingly: it names repository-root paths created this invocation for cleanup. When the write is in place on the coordination surface, pass an empty frozenset (nothing created in the root checkout). Read `write_artifact`'s use of that parameter first to get the semantics right.
  3. `base_content` (merge input for the append, read before ≈L280) must come from the owning surface: read from the coordination copy (worktree, else the coordination ref), not the root. Check how it is read today (L85 comment "resolution failure here degrades to an empty base"). Use the read resolver for READS. That is allowed, because the gate forbids read resolvers only as write locations.
  4. Render at ≈L298: `append_tracer_finding` returns the `WriteSeamResult`, and callers render it. `cli/commands/agent/tracer_append.py` (≈L135-163) hand-renders the caller-surface fields today, which is masking. This WP now owns it (post-tasks squad R-M2). Render JSON through `commit_outcome_payload` (additive: keep the existing keys `ok`, `kind`, `status`, `commit_ref`, `commit_hash`, … and add `surfaces`) and text through `render_commit_outcome`, and apply the shared exit-code rule. Test it in `tests/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/test_tracer_append_outcome.py` with a one-surface-skipped fixture. WP20 adds it to the consumer-pin floor. Inside `tracer_writer.py`, log a WARNING via `render_commit_outcome` when a surface is not committed/unchanged ("discarded-result" rule, D8).
- **Files**: `src/specify_cli/retrospective/tracer_writer.py`.
- **Validation**: T053 tracer tests green; `tests/retrospective/test_writer*.py`, `test_retrospective_durable_home_coord.py` green.
- **Edge cases**: two appends in a row must merge (the second sees the first's line). An owned checkout uses `placement_seam(..., owned=owned)`. Thread `owned` if `append_tracer_finding` has it.

### Subtask T056 – Issue matrix writes at `write_dir(ISSUE_MATRIX)`

- **Purpose**: `scaffold_issue_matrix` (L448) uses `coord_read_dir_for(...) or feature_dir`, a read resolver with a root fallback, as its write dir (WP20 census `tasks/issue_matrix.py::scaffold_issue_matrix`).
- **Steps**:
  1. Split read and write. The existence check ("respect existing content", ≈L507-510) is a READ: keep `coord_read_dir_for` / `read_dir` for it. The write location becomes `write_dir(ISSUE_MATRIX).path`, resolved lazily inside the `_stage` thunk of `write_issue_matrix` (≈L397-415) to keep zero-write refusals residue-free.
  2. `fold_into_caller_commit` (≈L517): when the write dir equals the caller's `feature_dir` (non-coordination topologies), keep today's direct atomic write. For coordination Missions the write dir is the coordination Mission dir, so this branch must not trigger. Keep the comparison semantics and test both arms.
  3. Render at ≈L404 (`write_issue_matrix` → `write_artifact` result): best-effort semantics stay ("never blocking"), but log a WARNING through `render_commit_outcome` when a surface is not committed/unchanged.
  4. Owned arm: `placement_seam(..., owned=owned).write_dir(ISSUE_MATRIX)`.
- **Files**: `src/specify_cli/tasks/issue_matrix.py`.
- **Validation**: T053 issue-matrix test green; existing issue-matrix tests (`grep -rl "issue_matrix" tests/ | head -20`, run by file) green.

### Subtask T057 – Acceptance matrix writes at `write_dir(ACCEPTANCE_MATRIX)`

- **Purpose**: `acceptance_verdict._matrix_read_dir` (L87) uses `read_dir(ACCEPTANCE_MATRIX)` as the dir passed to `write_and_commit_acceptance_matrix` (WP20 census `agent/acceptance_verdict.py::_matrix_read_dir`).
- **Steps**:
  1. In `acceptance_verdict.py`, keep `_matrix_read_dir` for reading the current matrix. Add the write location from `write_dir(ACCEPTANCE_MATRIX).path` for the write call. Simplest: change `_matrix_read_dir` into two helpers, `_matrix_read_dir` (read) and `_matrix_write_dir` (write). If the census qualname `_matrix_read_dir` must stay the writer's location provider, make sure that function no longer feeds the writer. Record the final qualnames for WP20.
  2. In `acceptance/matrix.py::write_and_commit_acceptance_matrix` (L469): the `matrix_dir` parameter is supplied by callers. Keep the signature (many callers and fixtures). Add a keyword option or a sibling function that resolves `write_dir` lazily inside `_stage`, so a refused write doesn't materialize. Keep `write_acceptance_matrix` (L449) byte-identical (raw writer for fixtures without git). Do not touch the `gates_core._evaluate_acceptance_matrix` no-commit leg (`--no-commit` / `--diagnose` must never commit; `tests/specify_cli/test_accept_no_commit_readonly.py`).
  3. Render at ≈L524: return the `WriteSeamResult` (now with `surfaces`). In `acceptance_verdict.py`, the command output (text + `--json`) renders via `render_commit_outcome` / `commit_outcome_payload` (additive JSON key `surfaces`), with exit code non-zero when any surface is refused/error.
  4. `primary_paths_created_this_invocation`: as in T055, empty when writing in place on the coordination surface.
- **Files**: `src/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/acceptance_verdict.py`, `src/specify_cli/acceptance/matrix.py`.
- **Validation**: T053 acceptance test green; `tests/acceptance/` (by file), `tests/integration/test_accept_matrix_coord_partition.py` and `tests/integration/test_issue_2404_acceptance_matrix_write_surface.py` (run these two named files only, never the integration directory), `tests/specify_cli/test_accept_no_commit_readonly.py` green.
- **Edge cases**: accept's own residual sweep (WP16) also picks up matrix dirt. After this WP, a coordination Mission's matrix dirt is in the coordination worktree. That's what WP16 expects (US3.6), so no change is needed here.

### Subtask T058 – Transient staging, rendering and C-008 tests

- **Purpose**: Lock in the edge case "Transient staging" and the outcome contract per consumer.
- **Steps**:
  1. For each writer, after the command returns, assert an empty root `git status --porcelain -- kitty-specs/<dir>`, and no file left under the root Mission dir that wasn't there before.
  2. Zero-write refusal: remote-only coordination branch (WP02 `remote_only=True`) → each writer returns `status="refused"` (or raises the documented error), with NO coordination worktree created, no seed, and no file written anywhere.
  3. One-surface-skipped / refused rendering per consumer (text lines from `render_commit_outcome`; JSON `surfaces` for acceptance-verdict).
  4. C-008: `lanes` and `single_branch` → each writer writes at the same path as before and commits to the same ref.
  5. Unit tests for every new helper (`_matrix_write_dir`, lazy-resolution thunks).
- **Files**: the four new test files.

## Targeted test surface

- New: `tests/coordination/test_write_seam_surfaces.py`, `tests/retrospective/test_tracer_writer_write_dir.py`, `tests/tasks/test_issue_matrix_write_dir.py`, `tests/acceptance/test_acceptance_matrix_write_dir.py`.
- Owning-module tests (by file): `tests/coordination/test_write_seam_adoption.py`, `tests/specify_cli/coordination/test_residual_writer_routing.py`, `tests/retrospective/` (fast tier), every issue-matrix and acceptance-verdict test file (`grep -rl "issue_matrix\|acceptance_verdict\|write_and_commit_acceptance_matrix\|append_tracer_finding" tests/`), `tests/specify_cli/test_accept_no_commit_readonly.py`. Named integration files only: `tests/integration/test_accept_matrix_coord_partition.py`, `tests/integration/test_issue_2404_acceptance_matrix_write_surface.py`.
- Baseline: `make test-fast`.
- Named architectural gates only: `tests/architectural/test_no_write_side_rederivation.py`, `tests/architectural/test_write_surface_placement_guard.py`, `tests/architectural/test_layer_rules.py`.
- Never run the bare `tests/architectural/`, any e2e or integration directory, performance or stress suites, or `make test-full` (NO_FULL_HEAVY_SUITES_IN_MISSION, C-006). Record commands and counts in the Activity Log. Classify unexplained reds with CLAUDE.md's baseline-red gotcha.
- Post-tasks squad addition: `tests/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/test_tracer_append_outcome.py` and `tests/specify_cli/retrospective/test_tracer_writer_coord_e2e.py`, by name.

## Quality gates

- Keep C901 ≤ 15 for every touched function (NFR-004): `write_artifact`, `scaffold_issue_matrix`, the acceptance-verdict command body. Extract helpers rather than growing them.
- Run `ruff check`, `ruff format --check` and `mypy --strict` on the changed files, with no new suppressions (NFR-005).
- Reach ≥ 90% coverage of new and changed lines, with focused tests per new branch or helper (NFR-003). If you add public symbols, run `tests/architectural/test_no_dead_symbols.py`.

## Issues

Issues: #5519 #5513

## Definition of Done

- T053 tests were committed first and RED on the lane base (output recorded); all are green at the end.
- The three writers write in place at `write_dir(kind)`, with no root residue, and zero-write refusals still touch no disk.
- `WriteSeamResult` carries `surfaces` / `commit_hashes` / `reason`, and the consumers render via the shared pair.
- The C-008 controls are green, the quality gates are green, and commands and counts are logged. Final writer qualnames are recorded for WP20.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Losing the #3073 zero-residue guarantee**: always resolve `write_dir` inside the `stage=` thunk. Test the remote-only refusal for every writer.
- **Wrong merge base for tracer appends**: read the base content from the owning surface. Test two sequential appends.
- **Breaking no-commit accept legs**: leave `write_acceptance_matrix` and `gates_core` untouched, and run `test_accept_no_commit_readonly.py`.

## Review Guidance

- The reviewer (opus, distinct from the implementer) verifies red→green: the T053 tests are RED on the WP's base and GREEN on the final commit.
- Check that `write_dir` is never called outside a stage thunk in the seam-routed writers, or justify each exception.
- Check that no consumer formats `SurfaceOutcome` by hand, and that the JSON is additive.
- Check the C-008 controls and the no-residue assertions.

## Activity Log

> **CRITICAL**: Activity log entries MUST be in chronological order (oldest first, newest last).

### How to Add Activity Log Entries

**When adding an entry**:

1. Scroll to the bottom of this Activity Log section
2. **APPEND the new entry at the END** (do NOT prepend or insert in middle)
3. Use exact format: `- YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ – agent_id – <action>`
4. Timestamp MUST be current time in UTC (check with `date -u "+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"`)
5. Agent ID should identify who made the change (claude-sonnet-4-5, codex, etc.)

**Format**:

```
- YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ – <agent_id> – <brief action description>
```

**Common mistakes (DO NOT DO THIS)**:

- Adding new entry at the top (breaks chronological order)
- Using future timestamps (causes acceptance validation to fail)
- Inserting in middle instead of appending to end

**Initial entry**:

- 2026-10-01T08:36:27Z – system – Prompt created.

### Updating Status

Status is managed via `status.events.jsonl`. Use `spec-kitty agent tasks move-task <WPID> --to <status>` to change WP status.
