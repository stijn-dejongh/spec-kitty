## Objectives & Success Criteria

Deliver the **one shared fixture harness** that every red-first reproduction in this Mission uses (FR-016, C-005, research "Red-first reproduction list"). It must construct each shape listed below, through the **production create path** or explicitly by hand.

**Production create path**:
- `create_mission_core`;
- the CLI `spec-kitty agent mission create --pr-bound --start-branch <topic>`;
- the CLI `spec-kitty agent mission create --topology coord|lanes_with_coord`.

**Shapes**:
- a coordination-routed Mission, parametrized over `coord` and `lanes_with_coord`;
- a **pre-fix shape**: root-checkout status log, coordination branch without the Mission dir, worktree absent or empty. It is built explicitly, so it stays valid after WP06 changes create;
- the four **NFR-002 fork fixtures**;
- probes for event ids, logical clocks, commit-range path history and coordination-branch trees.

**Success means**:
- `from tests._factories.coord_mission import make_coord_mission, make_prefix_coord_mission, make_fork_fixture, event_ids, lamports, commits_touching, coord_tree_has` works from any test module.
- `tests/coordination/conftest.py` exposes pytest fixtures wrapping them.
- `tests/coordination/test_coord_mission_factory.py` proves each builder produces its documented shape **at the current base**. These are green tests: this WP is the harness, not a fix.
- Later WPs (WP03-WP21) import from it rather than hand-rolling coordination fixtures.

## Context & Constraints

- **Load the charter**: `.kittify/charter/charter.md` and `spec-kitty charter context --action implement --json`.
- **Plan**: IC-02 ("Red-first reproduction harness"), including the risk that every reproduction lands with the WP that turns it green, and never as `xfail`. That is why this WP contains **no reproductions**; it only builds shapes.
- **Spec**:
  - FR-016 (red-first reproductions);
  - NFR-002 (the four fork fixtures: root uncommitted + coordination untracked, the #5519 shape; root committed on target + coordination committed; fresh clone; ledger only on the coordination branch);
  - US1 "Independent Test" (production create path, both coordination topologies);
  - C-005.
- **Data model**: §4, fork-report value objects (what the fork fixtures must make detectable); §6, coordination surface lifecycle (the UNMATERIALIZED / EMPTY / MATERIALIZED / DELETED states the builders must reach).
- **Existing factory**: `tests/_factories/__init__.py::make_mission` wraps `create_mission_core` and calls `provision_test_charter`. `create_mission_core` hard-requires an activated mission type and raises `CharterPackConfigError` without provisioning, so reuse `provision_test_charter`.
  - Signature: `create_mission_core(repo_root, mission_slug, *, topology=MissionTopology.COORD, pr_bound=False, target_branch=None, ...)` at `src/specify_cli/core/mission_creation.py:760`.
- **Topology caveat (CLAUDE.md "Create-time topology")**: in a repo with no `origin/HEAD`, primary-branch detection falls back to the current branch. Always pass the topology explicitly, and set up a remote with `origin/HEAD` for the `--pr-bound --start-branch` path.
- **Git template**: `tests/_support/git_template` provides a fast template. Reuse it, and the repo's `git_repo` marker (pytest.ini), where practical.
- **Model discipline**: implement = sonnet (`claude-sonnet-5`); review = opus.
- **Terminology**: Mission, never feature. Say "repository root checkout" or "target branch"; never bare "primary".
- **No heavy suites** (C-006).
- **Fixture semantics across lanes (post-tasks squad P-m5):** pre-fix assertions use WP02's `make_prefix_coord_mission`; `make_coord_mission` carries only shape-agnostic invariants (its shape changes when WP06 lands); use `make_coord_mission(..., materialized=True)` when a test needs a deterministic MATERIALIZED coordination surface in every lane.

## Branch Strategy

- **Strategy**: Planning artifacts were generated on issue-5440-coord-artifact-single-home; completed changes must merge back into issue-5440-coord-artifact-single-home.
- **Planning base branch**: `issue-5440-coord-artifact-single-home`
- **Merge target branch**: `issue-5440-coord-artifact-single-home`
- `finalize-tasks` allocates execution worktrees per computed lane from `lanes.json`.
- Start with `spec-kitty agent action implement WP02 --agent claude` and use the printed workspace path.
- **Lane-relevant shared files**: none. This WP owns only new test files, runs in its own lane, and can run in parallel with WP01, WP11 and WP19 from the start.

## Subtasks & Detailed Guidance

### Subtask T008 – Production-path factory `make_coord_mission`

- **Purpose**: One call yields a coordination-routed Mission created exactly the way an operator creates it, so a reproduction exercises the real create path (spec R10 / US1 Independent Test).
- **Steps**:
  1. Create `tests/_factories/coord_mission.py`, with a module docstring that cites this Mission and FR-016.
  2. Define a frozen dataclass `CoordMission`:
     ```python
     @dataclass(frozen=True)
     class CoordMission:
         repo_root: Path
         mission_slug: str
         mid8: str
         mission_dir_name: str          # kitty-specs/<dir> name as created
         topology: MissionTopology
         target_branch: str
         coordination_branch: str       # from meta.json
         coord_worktree_path: Path      # CoordinationWorkspace.worktree_path(...)
         creation_base_sha: str         # target tip BEFORE create ran
         @property
         def root_mission_dir(self) -> Path: ...
         @property
         def coord_mission_dir(self) -> Path: ...
     ```
  3. `make_coord_mission(tmp_path, topology, *, via="core", slug="demo", protected_primary=False) -> CoordMission`:
     - **Repo setup**: init a repo (template if available), `git config user.email/name`, initial commit, provision the charter (`provision_test_charter`), commit. For `via != "core"`, run `spec-kitty init . --ai claude --non-interactive` if the CLI path needs it; mirror the quickstart.md §0 fixture.
     - **`via="core"`**: create topic branch `topic`, record `creation_base_sha = git rev-parse topic`, then call `create_mission_core(repo_root, slug, topology=topology, target_branch="topic")`.
     - **`via="cli_topology"`**: on `topic`, run `spec-kitty agent mission create <slug> --topology <t> --branch-strategy already-confirmed --json` through the project's CLI test helper (find the established invoker: `CliRunner` over the Typer app, or a `subprocess` helper in `tests/_support`), then parse `mission_slug` / `coordination_branch` from the JSON.
     - **`via="cli_pr_bound"`**: from `main` (with a bare remote and `origin/HEAD` set), run `... --topology <t> --pr-bound --start-branch topic --branch-strategy already-confirmed --json`. Always pass `--topology` explicitly: `--pr-bound` alone resolves `lanes` on an unprotected primary branch (`_resolve_default_topology_phase`, `cli/commands/agent/mission_create.py:372`). Assert `meta.json` `topology` equals `<t>` after create so a factory call can never silently hand back a `lanes` Mission.
     - **`protected_primary=True`**: configure the primary branch as protected the way `ProtectionPolicy.resolve` reads it. Locate the config knob via `grep -rn "protected" src/specify_cli/policy/`. It is used by WP06's US1.4 test.
     - Read `meta.json` from the root Mission dir to fill `mid8`, `coordination_branch` and `target_branch`. Compute `coord_worktree_path` with `CoordinationWorkspace.worktree_path(repo_root, mission_slug, mid8)` (`src/specify_cli/coordination/workspace.py:270`).
  4. Export a helper `COORD_TOPOLOGIES = (MissionTopology.COORD, MissionTopology.LANES_WITH_COORD)` for `pytest.mark.parametrize`.
- **Files**: `tests/_factories/coord_mission.py`.
- **Validation**: T011 tests assert `meta.json["topology"]` equals the requested topology and that the coordination branch exists, for every `via` × topology combination.
- **Edge cases**:
  - The factory must not assume create's **current** placement of `status.events.jsonl`. After WP06 lands, the log is on the coordination branch and the root has none. Fields and probes must work for both.
  - Return values must be plain values; do not keep CLI runners open.

### Subtask T009 – Pre-fix shape builder `make_prefix_coord_mission`

- **Purpose**: Several reproductions need a Mission "created before this fix": status log in the repository root checkout (committed on the target branch), coordination branch cut **without** the Mission dir. Examples:
  - seed tests (WP03);
  - writer migrations (WP07, WP09, WP10);
  - consolidation R22 (WP18);
  - R6's legacy control (WP06).

  After WP06, create no longer produces that shape, so the builder must construct it **explicitly**.
- **Steps**:
  1. `make_prefix_coord_mission(tmp_path, topology, *, worktree="absent"|"empty", remote_only=False, branch_deleted=False, extra_events=0) -> CoordMission`.
  2. Construction:
     - create the repo and charter as in T008, plus a topic branch;
     - write `meta.json` through the production meta builder if reachable (preferred: call `create_mission_core`, then **rewrite** the outcome into the pre-fix shape);
     - ensure `kitty-specs/<dir>/status.events.jsonl` with `MissionCreated` and `SpecifyStarted` events, produced by the production emitter, exists in the root checkout and is committed on the target branch;
     - ensure the coordination branch tip does **not** contain `kitty-specs/<dir>/`; reset it to the pre-create commit if create seeded it;
     - remove the coordination worktree (`worktree="absent"`, state UNMATERIALIZED), or leave the worktree root without the Mission dir (`worktree="empty"`, state EMPTY).
  3. Variants:
     - `remote_only=True`: push the coordination branch to a bare `origin` and delete the local branch (the #4970 remote-only case);
     - `branch_deleted=True`: delete the branch everywhere (DELETED);
     - `extra_events=N`: append N status events in the root checkout, uncommitted.
  4. Assert the resulting state with the production probe `probe_coord_state` (`src/specify_cli/missions/_read_path_resolver.py`, `CoordState` at L250-275) inside the builder. A mis-built fixture then fails loudly at construction, never silently.
- **Files**: `tests/_factories/coord_mission.py`.
- **Validation**: T011 asserts `probe_coord_state(...)` returns `UNMATERIALIZED`, `EMPTY` or `DELETED` per variant, and that `git ls-tree -r <coord> -- kitty-specs/<dir>` is empty.
- **Edge cases**:
  - Rewriting create's output must not leave a stale coordination worktree registration. Run `git worktree prune` after removal.
  - On a remote-only branch, the probe may need the remote fetched. Follow the existing remote-probe tests (`tests/specify_cli/coordination/test_coord_branch_remote_probe_4979.py`).
- **`materialized=True` option (post-tasks squad R-M4)**: `make_coord_mission(..., materialized=True)` returns a seeded, **MATERIALIZED** coordination surface in every lane, independent of whether WP06 has landed. WP02 cannot depend on WP04 (`write_dir`), because that would be a cycle WP02 → WP04 → WP03 → WP02. Build it explicitly with git:
  1. Ensure the coordination worktree exists at `coord_worktree_path`, using `git worktree add` on the coordination branch, or `CoordinationWorkspace.resolve` if that is pure enough.
  2. If the coordination branch tree lacks `kitty-specs/<dir>/`, copy the creation events (MissionCreated/SpecifyStarted) into `<coord wt>/kitty-specs/<dir>/status.events.jsonl` and commit them on the coordination branch (`chore(<mission>): fixture seed`). Copy COORD records only, never `meta.json` (US1.3).
  3. Assert the production coordination-state probe reports MATERIALIZED (the `CoordState` classifier in `missions/_read_path_resolver.py`; find the exact probe function, e.g. `probe_coord_state`) before returning. The builder fails loudly otherwise.
  WP13/WP14/WP15 use this so their red-first fixtures hold at their lane base (WP01–WP05), where create does not yet seed.

### Subtask T010 – NFR-002 fork fixtures and probes

- **Purpose**: These fixtures are shared by WP03 (seed fork refusal), WP17 (doctor fork detection, repair, verify) and WP21. They let tests count "0 entries lost, 0 events lost, no id twice" (NFR-002, SC-004).
- **Steps**:
  1. `make_fork_fixture(tmp_path, shape, topology=COORD) -> ForkFixture`, where `ForkFixture` extends `CoordMission` with `decision_ids_root`, `decision_ids_coord` and `clone_root: Path | None`. Shapes:
     - **(a) `"root_uncommitted_coord_untracked"`** (the #5519 shape): pre-fix Mission; the first decision is opened in the root checkout (uncommitted); a coordination Mission dir then exists with a second, diverging decision event (untracked in the coordination worktree). The two status logs are non-empty and neither event-id sequence is a prefix of the other.
     - **(b) `"both_committed"`**: like (a), but the root copy is committed on the target branch and the coordination copy is committed on the coordination branch.
     - **(c) `"fresh_clone"`**: `git clone` of (b) into `clone_root`, fetching both branches as local branches, with no coordination worktree. Fork detection must work from refs.
     - **(d) `"ledger_only_on_coordination"`**: `decisions/DM-<ulid>.md` plus `decisions/index.json` committed **only** on the coordination branch (the pre-fix #3928 placement), absent from the root checkout and the target branch.
  2. Produce decision events with the production emitters where possible: `specify_cli.decisions.service` open/resolve, writing into a chosen dir. If the service now routes elsewhere (later WPs change it), fall back to the event model plus `append_event` from `specify_cli.status.store` or the decisions event writer. Keep event JSON production-shaped (`event_id`, `event_lamport`, `event_type`, ...).
  3. Probes (pure helpers):
     - `event_ids(source: Path | tuple[Path, str, str]) -> tuple[str, ...]`: from a file, or from `(repo, ref, relpath)` via `git show`;
     - `lamports(...)`: same sources, returning the logical clocks;
     - `commits_touching(repo, rev_range, relpath) -> list[str]`: `git log --format=%H <range> -- <path>`;
     - `coord_tree_has(repo, branch, relpath) -> bool`: `git ls-tree`;
     - `index_entry_ids(path_or_blob) -> set[str]`: reads `decisions/index.json`.
- **Files**: `tests/_factories/coord_mission.py`.
- **Validation**: T011 asserts, for each shape:
  - (a)/(b): the two sequences are non-empty and non-prefix; for (a) the decision ids differ per surface.
  - (c): no worktree, but `event_ids((clone, coord_branch, path))` is non-empty.
  - (d): the ledger is present on the coordination ref only.
- **Edge cases**:
  - Event ids are ULIDs. Generate them with the production id minting, not hard-coded strings that might collide.
  - `lamports` must parse the field name the status model actually uses. Check `src/specify_cli/status/models.py` for `event_lamport` or its equivalent before coding it.

### Subtask T011 – Pytest fixtures and factory self-tests

- **Purpose**: Make the harness ergonomic for pytest, and pin that each builder keeps producing its documented shape. A broken fixture would make every later red-first test vacuous.
- **Steps**:
  1. `tests/coordination/conftest.py` (new; `tests/coordination/` currently has no conftest and no `__init__.py`). Define:
     - `coord_mission` (parametrized over both topologies via `params=`);
     - `prefix_coord_mission` (default `worktree="empty"`);
     - `fork_fixture` (indirect-parametrizable by shape).

     Fixtures delegate to `tests._factories.coord_mission`, which is the importable helper other test directories use. Check that the root `tests/conftest.py` already puts the repository root on `sys.path`, so `tests._factories` imports; `tests/_factories/__init__.py` exists.
  2. `tests/coordination/test_coord_mission_factory.py` holds one test per builder and variant (green at the current base):
     - every `via` × topology: topology recorded, coordination branch exists, `creation_base_sha` is an ancestor of the target tip;
     - pre-fix variants: probe state as documented; the root log has `MissionCreated`;
     - each fork shape: the assertions listed in T010;
     - probes on a tiny hand-made repo (`commits_touching` empty versus non-empty).
  3. Markers:
     - mark git-heavy tests with `git_repo` (pytest.ini);
     - pure probe tests with `fast`/`unit`;
     - none of these may need `slow` (target < 30 s per test).
  4. In the module docstring, add a short "How later WPs use this" section listing the R-ids that rely on each builder (research red-first list): R1/R1b/R6/R20 (WP06), R2 (WP05), R3/R14/R15/R16 (WP17), R4 (WP09), R22/R23/R24 (WP18).
- **Files**: `tests/coordination/conftest.py`, `tests/coordination/test_coord_mission_factory.py`.
- **Validation**: `uv run --frozen pytest tests/coordination/test_coord_mission_factory.py -q` is green. Run the whole `tests/coordination/` directory once, to prove the new conftest breaks no existing test there (name clashes with existing fixtures).
- **Edge cases**: fixture names must not shadow existing fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`. Grep for `def coord_mission` / `prefix_` before naming.

## Targeted test surface

- Baseline: `make test-fast`.
- This WP:
  ```bash
  uv run --frozen pytest tests/coordination/test_coord_mission_factory.py -q
  uv run --frozen pytest tests/coordination/ -q                 # no fixture clash in the directory the conftest governs
  uv run --frozen pytest tests/_factories/test_make_mission_parity.py -q
  ```
- Named architectural gate files only: none required (test-only change). If you add any `src/` import shim, stop: this WP owns no `src/` file.
- Never run the bare `tests/architectural/`, any e2e/integration directory, performance/stress suites or `make test-full` (NO_FULL_HEAVY_SUITES_IN_MISSION, C-006).
- Record commands and counts in the Activity Log. Classify unrelated reds with the CLAUDE.md baseline-red gotcha.

## Quality gates

- C901 ≤ 15 for every function (NFR-004). Builders are naturally long, so split them into private step helpers.
- `ruff check`, `ruff format --check` and `mypy --strict` are clean on the three new files (NFR-005). Tests are typed too: annotate fixtures and helpers.
- ≥ 90% coverage of the new helper module from the self-tests (NFR-003).

## Issues

Issues: none owed directly (harness for the FR-016 reproductions).

## Definition of Done

- `tests/_factories/coord_mission.py` exposes:
  - `make_coord_mission`, `make_prefix_coord_mission`, `make_fork_fixture`;
  - the probes `event_ids`, `lamports`, `commits_touching`, `coord_tree_has`, `index_entry_ids`;
  - `COORD_TOPOLOGIES`.
- `tests/coordination/conftest.py` fixtures exist, and the whole `tests/coordination/` directory still passes.
- Self-tests are green at the current base for every builder and variant.
- The pre-fix builder constructs its shape explicitly and validates it with the production probe.
- ruff, format and mypy --strict are clean.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Fixture drifts when create changes (WP06).** Mitigation: the pre-fix builder rewrites create's output into an explicit shape and validates it with `probe_coord_state`.
- **Slow fixtures** multiply across many tests. Mitigation: the git template, minimal commits, and avoiding the CLI path except when `via` asks for it.
- **Production-emitter routing changes in later WPs** (decision writers move in WP09). Mitigation: the fork builders write events into an explicit dir through low-level append helpers, so they never depend on the routing under test.
- **Fixture-name collisions.** Mitigation: grep first, and use distinctive names.

## Review Guidance

- Reviewer: opus, distinct from the implementer.
- This WP has no product red test, because it is the harness. Verify instead:
  1. the self-tests pass on the WP's final commit;
  2. each builder's docstring matches its asserted shape;
  3. the pre-fix builder does not depend on create's current status-log placement;
  4. probes use git plumbing (`git show`, `git ls-tree`, `git log --format=%H`) rather than parsing porcelain;
  5. no `src/` file changed.

## Activity Log

> **CRITICAL**: Activity log entries MUST be in chronological order (oldest first, newest last).

### How to Add Activity Log Entries

**When adding an entry**:

1. Scroll to the bottom of this Activity Log section
2. **APPEND the new entry at the END** (do NOT prepend or insert in middle)
3. Use exact format: `- YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ – agent_id – <action>`
4. Timestamp MUST be current time in UTC (check with `date -u "+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"`)
5. Agent ID should identify who made the change (claude-sonnet-4-5, codex, etc.)

**Format**:

```
- YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ – <agent_id> – <brief action description>
```

**Common mistakes (DO NOT DO THIS)**:

- Adding new entry at the top (breaks chronological order)
- Using future timestamps (causes acceptance validation to fail)
- Inserting in middle instead of appending to end

**Why this matters**: The acceptance system reads the LAST activity log entry as the current state. If entries are out of order, acceptance will fail even when the work is complete.

**Initial entry**:

- 2026-10-01T08:36:27Z – system – Prompt created.

### Updating Status

Status is managed via `status.events.jsonl`. Use `spec-kitty agent tasks move-task <WPID> --to <status>` to change WP status.
