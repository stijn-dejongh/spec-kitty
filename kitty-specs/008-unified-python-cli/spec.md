# Feature Specification: Unified Python CLI for Agents

*Path: [kitty-specs/008-unified-python-cli/spec.md](kitty-specs/008-unified-python-cli/spec.md)*

**Feature Branch**: `008-unified-python-cli`
**Created**: 2025-12-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Migrate all bash scripts to a unified Python CLI under spec-kitty agent namespace, eliminating worktree script copying and providing agents with a reliable, location-aware command interface"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - AI Agent Executes Workflow Without Path Errors (Priority: P1)

AI agents using spec-kitty slash commands (like `/spec-kitty.implement`, `/spec-kitty.review`) can execute workflows successfully regardless of their current location (main repository or worktree), without encountering path resolution errors or needing to locate bash scripts.

**Why this priority**: This is the core problem being solved. Agents currently struggle with bash scripts, path confusion, and script copying. Until this works reliably, agents cannot effectively use spec-kitty.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having an AI agent execute any spec-kitty slash command from both main repository and worktree locations, verifying zero path-related errors occur.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an AI agent is working in the main repository, **When** it executes `/spec-kitty.implement` (which calls `spec-kitty agent` commands), **Then** the command succeeds and correctly resolves paths without requiring the agent to specify location context
2. **Given** an AI agent is working in a worktree (`.worktrees/feature-name/`), **When** it executes any `spec-kitty agent` command, **Then** the CLI automatically detects the worktree location and resolves all paths correctly
3. **Given** an AI agent needs to move a task between lanes, **When** it uses `spec-kitty agent workflow implement WP01`, **Then** the task transitions correctly regardless of whether the agent is in main repo or worktree
4. **Given** bash scripts previously needed to be copied to worktrees, **When** the Python CLI is installed, **Then** no script copying occurs and agents can immediately use `spec-kitty agent` commands

### User Story 2 - Existing Projects Upgrade Automatically (Priority: P2)

Users with existing spec-kitty projects (that currently use bash scripts and old slash command templates) can run `spec-kitty upgrade` to automatically migrate their projects to use the new `spec-kitty agent` command interface without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: Without automatic upgrade, existing users would need to manually update slash commands, delete bash scripts, and reconfigure their projects. This is error-prone and creates adoption friction.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a spec-kitty project with the old bash-based structure, running `spec-kitty upgrade`, and verifying all slash commands now use `spec-kitty agent` commands and bash scripts are removed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a spec-kitty project using bash scripts in `.kittify/scripts/bash/`, **When** user runs `spec-kitty upgrade`, **Then** all bash scripts are removed and slash command templates are updated to call `spec-kitty agent` commands
2. **Given** a project has custom slash commands referencing bash scripts, **When** upgrade runs, **Then** the migration detects these references and either updates them automatically or warns the user about manual updates needed
3. **Given** a project is in a worktree with copied bash scripts, **When** upgrade runs, **Then** the copied scripts are removed and the worktree is cleaned up
4. **Given** the upgrade migration completes, **When** an AI agent executes any slash command, **Then** the command works correctly with the new Python CLI

---

### User Story 3 - Developers Can Test Agent Workflows (Priority: P3)

Developers contributing to spec-kitty can run unit tests and integration tests for all `spec-kitty agent` commands, ensuring agent workflows are reliable and regression-free.

**Why this priority**: Currently bash scripts are difficult to test, making it hard to catch regressions. While important for quality, this is lower priority than solving the immediate agent pain points.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the test suite (`pytest`) and verifying all agent commands have test coverage showing they work from various locations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer modifies path resolution logic, **When** they run unit tests, **Then** tests verify the logic works correctly from main repo, worktrees, and edge cases
2. **Given** a developer adds a new agent command, **When** they run integration tests, **Then** tests verify the command works with JSON output mode and from all locations
3. **Given** a contributor wants to ensure cross-platform compatibility, **When** tests run on CI/CD, **Then** tests pass on Windows, macOS, and Linux

---

### User Story 4 - Research Validates Migration Approach (Priority: P0)

Before implementation begins, a research phase validates that the proposed migration approach (unified CLI, path resolution strategy, upgrade mechanism) is feasible and identifies any risks or alternative approaches.

**Why this priority**: P0 (prerequisite) because we must validate the approach before committing to implementation. The detailed plan provided needs validation against the actual codebase.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by reviewing research findings document that answers key validation questions and provides go/no-go recommendation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the proposed plan suggests eliminating all bash scripts, **When** research is conducted, **Then** findings confirm all bash functionality can be migrated to Python or identify exceptions
2. **Given** the plan proposes a specific path resolution strategy, **When** research validates it, **Then** findings confirm it handles all edge cases (symlinks, broken worktrees, Windows) or suggest alternatives
3. **Given** the upgrade migration approach is proposed, **When** research validates it, **Then** findings confirm the migration can safely update existing projects or identify migration risks
4. **Given** research identifies risks or blockers, **When** findings are documented, **Then** alternative approaches or mitigation strategies are provided

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an agent executes a command from a broken/incomplete worktree (e.g., symlinks broken)?
- How does the system handle Windows environments where symlinks may not be supported?
- What happens if an agent tries to use `spec-kitty agent` commands in a non-spec-kitty repository?
- How does the upgrade migration handle projects with custom modifications to bash scripts?
- What happens if an agent is in a deeply nested directory within a worktree?
- How does the system behave if `.kittify/` directory is missing or corrupted?
- What happens during upgrade if the project has uncommitted changes or is in a dirty git state?

- **SC-008**: Cross-platform compatibility verified on Windows, macOS, and Linux (CI/CD tests pass on all platforms)

## Assumptions *(optional)*

- Existing spec-kitty codebase already uses Python 3.11+ and Typer for CLI framework
- Existing `spec-kitty upgrade` infrastructure can be extended for this migration
- AI agents can parse JSON output from commands
- Most existing projects have not heavily customized bash scripts (custom modifications will require manual migration)
- Git worktrees follow standard structure (`.worktrees/feature-name/`)
- The detailed migration plan provided (7 phases, 11 days) is a starting point subject to validation during research phase

## Out of Scope *(optional)*

- Migrating git hooks (e.g., `pre-commit-task-workflow.sh`) to Python in this phase
- Migrating meta-scripts in `.github/workflows/scripts/` (these are for spec-kitty deployment, not part of the package)
- Migrating development tools in `scripts/` like `setup-sandbox.sh` and `refresh-kittify-tasks.sh` (developer utilities)
- Providing backward compatibility for bash scripts (clean cut migration)
- Supporting non-standard worktree structures
- Migrating non-spec-kitty bash scripts in user codebases
- Creating a daemon mode for long-running agent sessions (future enhancement)

## Dependencies *(optional)*

- Python 3.11+ runtime environment
- Existing spec-kitty codebase (`src/specify_cli/`)
- Git for worktree detection
- Typer CLI framework
- pathlib, Rich, subprocess (existing dependencies)

## Risks & Mitigations *(optional)*

**Risk**: Custom bash script modifications in existing projects cannot be auto-migrated
**Mitigation**: Upgrade migration detects custom modifications and provides clear warnings with migration guide

**Risk**: Windows symlink limitations may cause issues
**Mitigation**: Fall back to file copying on Windows (already implemented pattern in codebase)

**Risk**: Research phase may invalidate proposed approach
**Mitigation**: Research phase is P0 (prerequisite) - implementation only proceeds after validation

**Risk**: Breaking changes during migration period may disrupt active users
**Mitigation**: Clear upgrade documentation, release notes, and automated migration via `spec-kitty upgrade`

**Risk**: Path resolution edge cases (broken symlinks, nested worktrees) may not be fully handled
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing of edge cases and graceful error messages when edge cases cannot be handled
