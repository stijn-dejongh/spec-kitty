# Work Package Prompt: WP10 – Documentation and Migration Guide

**Implementation command:**
```bash
spec-kitty implement WP10 --base WP09
```

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Review Feedback Status

**Read this first if you are implementing this task!**

- **Has review feedback?**: Check the `review_status` field above. If it says `has_feedback`, scroll to the **Review Feedback** section immediately.
- **You must address all feedback** before your work is complete.
- **Mark as acknowledged**: Update `review_status: acknowledged` when you begin addressing feedback.

---

## Review Feedback

> **Populated by `/spec-kitty.review`** – Reviewers add detailed feedback here when work needs changes.

### Changes requested

1) **CHANGELOG contains inaccurate API details**
   - `CHANGELOG.md` references a `DependencyGraph` class with methods like `build_graph()` and `get_dependents()`, but the actual module is function-based (`build_dependency_graph`, `detect_cycles`, `validate_dependencies`). Please update the 0.11.0 entry to reflect real code and remove unsupported claims (e.g., `DependencyGraph.get_dependents`).

2) **Docs claim `/spec-kitty.tasks` auto-generates dependencies and commits**
   - `docs/workspace-per-wp.md`, `kitty-specs/010-workspace-per-work-package-for-parallel-development/quickstart.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` say dependencies and commits happen directly during `/spec-kitty.tasks`. In current implementation this requires running `spec-kitty agent feature finalize-tasks`. Update docs to include the finalize step and avoid implying auto-commit without it.

3) **Upgrade guide uses destructive cleanup without warning**
   - `docs/upgrading-to-0-11-0.md` suggests `git reset --hard HEAD~1` when cleaning the test feature. Add a clear warning and offer a safer alternative (e.g., `git revert` or delete the test feature with a dedicated commit).

### Re-review findings (still unresolved)

4) **CHANGELOG still lists non-existent dependency API**
   - `CHANGELOG.md` lists `get_dependents()` and still implies `/spec-kitty.tasks` handles dependency validation/commits directly. The module is function-based and there is no `get_dependents()` implementation. Please align the changelog with the actual public functions and the `finalize-tasks` flow.

5) **Workflow docs still omit finalize-tasks**
   - `docs/workspace-per-wp.md`, `kitty-specs/010-workspace-per-work-package-for-parallel-development/quickstart.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` still state that `/spec-kitty.tasks` generates dependency frontmatter and commits. Please update these to explicitly require `spec-kitty agent feature finalize-tasks` and clarify what `/spec-kitty.tasks` produces vs. what finalization does.

6) **Upgrade guide still uses destructive cleanup without warning**
   - `docs/upgrading-to-0-11-0.md` still contains `git reset --hard HEAD~1` in Step 8. Add a warning and suggest `git revert` or a normal delete+commit alternative.

7) **CHANGELOG still says `/spec-kitty.tasks` commits dependencies**
   - `CHANGELOG.md` still claims `/spec-kitty.tasks` generates dependencies and commits WP files directly. Current behavior requires `spec-kitty agent feature finalize-tasks`, so update this section to avoid misleading users.

## Objectives & Success Criteria

**Primary Goal**: Create comprehensive documentation for workspace-per-WP feature, including migration guide, workflow documentation, breaking change notes, and changelog.

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Migration guide created with step-by-step upgrade instructions
- ✅ Workspace-per-WP workflow documented with examples
- ✅ Dependency syntax documented
- ✅ README.md updated with 0.11.0 breaking change notes
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md updated with 0.11.0 entry
- ✅ quickstart.md expanded with real scenarios
- ✅ CLAUDE.md updated with development guidelines
- ✅ User can successfully upgrade from 0.10.x to 0.11.0 following docs

---

## Context & Constraints

**Why comprehensive docs critical**: This is a breaking change (0.10.12 → 0.11.0). Users will be frustrated if upgrade instructions are unclear or incomplete. Documentation must be thorough enough for self-service migration.

**Reference Documents**:
- [spec.md](../spec.md) - User Stories 3, 4 (planning workflow, dependency handling)
- [plan.md](../plan.md) - Breaking Change Communication section
- [quickstart.md](../quickstart.md) - Already exists, needs expansion with real examples
- [data-model.md](../data-model.md) - Example scenarios to document

**Documentation Tone**:
- Clear and direct (not marketing-speak)
- Step-by-step for migration guide
- Examples for common workflows
- Warnings for breaking changes
- Troubleshooting sections for common errors

---

## Subtasks & Detailed Guidance

### Subtask T086 – Create workspace-per-WP workflow documentation

**Purpose**: Document the new workspace-per-WP workflow with examples and comparisons to old model.

**Steps**:
1. Create `docs/workspace-per-wp.md`
2. Structure:
   ```markdown
   # Workspace-per-Work-Package (v0.11.0+)

   ## Overview

   Spec Kitty 0.11.0 introduces workspace-per-WP model to enable parallel multi-agent development.

   **Key Change**: One worktree per work package (instead of one per feature)

   ## Benefits

   - Multiple agents work on different WPs simultaneously
   - Each WP has isolated workspace
   - Parallel development reduces time-to-completion
   - Foundation for future jj integration (auto-rebase)

   ## Workflow Comparison

   ### Old (0.10.x)
   - `/spec-kitty.specify` → Creates .worktrees/###-feature/
   - All WPs work in same worktree
   - Sequential development

   ### New (0.11.0)
   - `/spec-kitty.specify` → Works in main, NO worktree
   - `spec-kitty implement WP01` → Creates .worktrees/###-feature-WP01/
   - `spec-kitty implement WP02` → Creates .worktrees/###-feature-WP02/
   - Parallel development

   ## Examples

   ### Independent WPs (Parallel Development)
   [Example with 3 independent WPs implemented in parallel]

   ### Dependent WPs (Dependency Chains)
   [Example with WP02 depending on WP01]

   ### Complex Dependencies (Fan-out)
   [Example with WP02, WP03, WP04 all depending on WP01]

   ## Dependency Syntax

   [Document frontmatter dependencies field]

   ## Common Patterns

   [Linear chain, fan-out, diamond patterns from data-model.md]

   ## Troubleshooting

   [Common errors and solutions]
   ```

3. Include diagrams/examples from data-model.md Example Scenarios section
4. Expand with real commands users can copy-paste

**Files**: `docs/workspace-per-wp.md` (NEW file)

**Parallel?**: Can write in parallel with T087-T093 (different files)

### Subtask T087 – Create upgrade guide

**Purpose**: Step-by-step guide for upgrading from 0.10.x to 0.11.0.

**Steps**:
1. Create `docs/upgrading-to-0-11-0.md`
2. Structure:
   ```markdown
   # Upgrading to Spec Kitty 0.11.0

   **⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE**: Workspace model changed to workspace-per-WP

   ## Before You Upgrade

   **Critical**: Complete or delete all in-progress features before upgrading.

   ### Step 1: Check for Legacy Worktrees

   ```bash
   ls .worktrees/
   ```

   Look for directories matching pattern `###-feature` (without `-WP##` suffix).

   Examples of legacy worktrees:
   - `008-unified-python-cli/` ← Legacy
   - `009-jujutsu-vcs/` ← Legacy
   - `010-workspace-per-wp-WP01/` ← New (OK)

   Or use utility command:
   ```bash
   spec-kitty list-legacy-features
   ```

   ### Step 2: Complete or Delete Features

   **Option A: Complete features (recommended)**
   ```bash
   spec-kitty merge 008-unified-python-cli
   spec-kitty merge 009-jujutsu-vcs
   ```

   **Option B: Delete features (if abandoning)**
   ```bash
   git worktree remove .worktrees/008-unified-python-cli
   git branch -D 008-unified-python-cli

   git worktree remove .worktrees/009-jujutsu-vcs
   git branch -D 009-jujutsu-vcs
   ```

   ### Step 3: Verify Clean State

   ```bash
   ls .worktrees/
   # Should be empty or only show ###-feature-WP## patterns
   ```

   ### Step 4: Upgrade

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade spec-kitty-cli
   spec-kitty --version  # Should show 0.11.0
   ```

   ### Step 5: Verify Upgrade

   Create a test feature to verify new workflow:
   ```bash
   /spec-kitty.specify "Test Feature"
   # Notice: NO worktree created!
   ls .worktrees/  # Still empty

   git log --oneline
   # Should see: "Add spec for feature 012-test-feature"
   ```

   ## If Upgrade is Blocked

   Error message:
   ```
   ❌ Cannot upgrade to 0.11.0
   Legacy worktrees detected:
     - 008-unified-python-cli
   ```

   **Resolution**: Go back to Step 2, complete or delete the listed features.

   ## What Changed in 0.11.0

   [Document workflow changes, new commands, removed behavior]

   ## Rollback

   If you need to downgrade:
   ```bash
   pip install spec-kitty-cli==0.10.12
   ```

   **Note**: Features planned in 0.11.0 (artifacts in main) will need re-planning in 0.10.12 (worktree model).

   ## Getting Help

   [Link to issues, documentation, troubleshooting]
   ```

3. Test guide by following it on a test project
4. Include screenshots or command output examples

**Files**: `docs/upgrading-to-0-11-0.md` (NEW file)

**Parallel?**: Can write in parallel with T086, T088-T093

---

### Subtask T088 – Document pre-upgrade checklist

**Purpose**: Clear checklist users can follow before upgrading.

**Steps**:
1. Create checklist section in upgrading-to-0-11-0.md (T087)
2. Checklist content:
   ```markdown
   ## Pre-Upgrade Checklist

   Before upgrading to 0.11.0, complete ALL items:

   - [ ] **List in-progress features**
     ```bash
     ls .worktrees/
     # Or: spec-kitty list-legacy-features
     ```

   - [ ] **For each legacy worktree, decide**: Merge or Delete
     - Complete: `spec-kitty merge <feature>`
     - Delete: `git worktree remove .worktrees/<feature>` + `git branch -D <branch>`

   - [ ] **Verify clean state**
     ```bash
     ls .worktrees/
     # Should be empty or only ###-feature-WP## patterns
     ```

   - [ ] **Backup important work** (if any uncommitted changes)

   - [ ] **Read breaking changes**: Review what changed in 0.11.0

   - [ ] **Upgrade**
     ```bash
     pip install --upgrade spec-kitty-cli
     spec-kitty --version  # Verify 0.11.0
     ```

   - [ ] **Test with dummy feature**
     ```bash
     /spec-kitty.specify "Test"
     # Verify no worktree created
     # Verify spec.md in main
     ```

   **If any checklist item fails**, resolve before proceeding to next step.
   ```

**Files**: `docs/upgrading-to-0-11-0.md` (section within file)

**Parallel?**: Part of T087

### Subtask T089 – Document dependency syntax

**Purpose**: Explain how to declare dependencies in WP frontmatter and what it means.

**Steps**:
1. Add to `docs/workspace-per-wp.md` (T086) or create separate doc
2. Content:
   ```markdown
   ## Dependency Syntax

   ### Declaring Dependencies in WP Frontmatter

   Dependencies are declared in each WP's frontmatter using YAML list syntax:

   ```yaml
   ---
   work_package_id: "WP02"
   title: "Build API"
   dependencies: ["WP01"]  # This WP depends on WP01
   ---
   ```

   ### Multiple Dependencies

   ```yaml
   dependencies: ["WP01", "WP03"]  # Depends on both WP01 and WP03
   ```

   **Note**: Git can only branch from ONE base. If WP has multiple dependencies, use `--base` for primary dependency, manually merge others.

   ### No Dependencies

   ```yaml
   dependencies: []  # Independent WP, branches from main
   ```

   ## How Dependencies Work

   **At implementation time**:
   - `spec-kitty implement WP02 --base WP01` creates workspace branching from WP01's branch
   - WP02 workspace contains WP01's code changes
   - WP02 builds on WP01's foundation

   **During review cycles**:
   - If WP01 changes, WP02 needs manual rebase (git limitation)
   - Warnings displayed to guide rebase process
   - Future jj integration will auto-rebase

   ## Validation Rules

   - Dependencies must reference valid WP IDs (WP##)
   - Cannot depend on self (WP01 → WP01)
   - No circular dependencies (WP01 → WP02 → WP01)
   - Dependencies detected during `/spec-kitty.tasks` generation

   ## Invalid Dependencies (Examples)

   ```yaml
   dependencies: ["WP1"]   # Invalid: must be WP##
   dependencies: ["WP99"]  # Invalid: WP99 doesn't exist
   dependencies: ["WP02"]  # Invalid in WP02 (self-dependency)
   ```
   ```

**Files**: `docs/workspace-per-wp.md` or `docs/dependency-syntax.md`

**Parallel?**: Can write in parallel with T086-T088, T090-T093

---

### Subtask T090 – Update README.md with breaking change notes

**Purpose**: Alert users in main README about 0.11.0 breaking change.

**Steps**:
1. Open `README.md` in repository root
2. Add breaking change notice near top (after title, before features):
   ```markdown
   ## ⚠️ Breaking Change in v0.11.0

   **Workspace model changed to workspace-per-WP for parallel multi-agent development.**

   **What changed**:
   - Planning commands (specify, plan, tasks) now work in main repository
   - Worktrees created on-demand during `spec-kitty implement WP##`
   - One worktree per work package (not per feature)

   **Action required before upgrading**:
   - Complete or delete in-progress features (0.10.x worktrees)
   - See [Upgrade Guide](docs/upgrading-to-0-11-0.md)

   **New in 0.11.0**:
   - Parallel WP development (multiple agents on different WPs)
   - Dependency tracking in WP frontmatter
   - New command: `spec-kitty implement WP##`

   [📖 Full upgrade guide](docs/upgrading-to-0-11-0.md) | [📚 Workspace-per-WP docs](docs/workspace-per-wp.md)
   ```

3. Update installation section if needed (version number)
4. Update workflow examples to reflect new model

**Files**: `README.md`

**Parallel?**: Can write in parallel with T086-T089, T091-T093

---

### Subtask T091 – Update CHANGELOG.md

**Purpose**: Document all changes in 0.11.0 release for changelog.

**Steps**:
1. Open `CHANGELOG.md`
2. Add 0.11.0 entry at top:
   ```markdown
   ## [0.11.0] - 2026-01-XX

   **⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES**

   ### Workspace Model Changed

   **Old (0.10.x)**: One worktree per feature
   - `/spec-kitty.specify` created `.worktrees/###-feature/`
   - All WPs worked in same worktree

   **New (0.11.0)**: One worktree per work package
   - Planning commands work in main repository (no worktree created)
   - `spec-kitty implement WP##` creates `.worktrees/###-feature-WP##/`
   - Each WP has isolated worktree

   **Migration Required**:
   - Complete or delete in-progress features before upgrading
   - Use `spec-kitty list-legacy-features` to check
   - See [Upgrade Guide](docs/upgrading-to-0-11-0.md)

   ### Added

   - **New command**: `spec-kitty implement WP## [--base WPXX]` - Create workspace for work package
   - **New utility**: `spec-kitty list-legacy-features` - Check for legacy worktrees before upgrade
   - **Dependency tracking**: WP frontmatter includes `dependencies: []` field
   - **Dependency graph utilities**: Cycle detection, validation, parsing
   - **Review warnings**: Alerts when dependent WPs need rebase
   - **Parallel development**: Multiple agents can work on different WPs simultaneously

   ### Changed

   - **`/spec-kitty.specify`**: Now works in main repository, commits spec.md to main, NO worktree created
   - **`/spec-kitty.plan`**: Now works in main repository, commits plan.md to main
   - **`/spec-kitty.tasks`**: Now works in main repository, generates dependencies in WP frontmatter, commits to main
   - **`spec-kitty merge`**: Handles multiple WP branches (workspace-per-WP model)
   - **All 12 agent templates**: Updated for new workflow (specify, plan, tasks, implement)

   ### Removed

   - **Worktree creation during planning**: Planning commands no longer create worktrees
   - **Legacy worktree support**: 0.11.0 does not support pre-0.11.0 worktree structure (must migrate first)

   ### Fixed

   - N/A (new feature, no bug fixes)

   ### Deprecated

   - Legacy worktree model (0.10.x) - maintain 0.10.x branch for 6 months

   ## [0.10.12] - 2026-01-XX

   [Previous version entries...]
   ```

3. Follow Keep a Changelog format (https://keepachangelog.com)
4. Include all changes from this feature

**Files**: `CHANGELOG.md`

**Parallel?**: Can write in parallel with T086-T090, T092-T093

**Note**: Update release date when actually releasing (leave as 2026-01-XX for now)

---

### Subtask T092 – Expand quickstart.md with real scenarios

**Purpose**: quickstart.md already exists from planning phase - expand it with real-world scenarios users can follow.

**Steps**:
1. Open `kitty-specs/010-workspace-per-work-package-for-parallel-development/quickstart.md`
2. Add sections if missing:
   - Real feature example (not placeholder "011-my-feature")
   - Actual spec-kitty codebase example (e.g., "How this feature was built")
   - Common errors with solutions
   - Tips and tricks
3. Expand existing examples with actual commands and output
4. Add visual diagrams if helpful (ASCII art dependency graphs)

**Files**: `kitty-specs/010-workspace-per-work-package-for-parallel-development/quickstart.md`

**Example Addition**:
```markdown
## Real Example: This Feature (010-workspace-per-wp)

This feature itself was built using the NEW workspace-per-WP model as a dogfooding exercise:

### Planning Phase (in main)
```bash
# Ran in main repository
/spec-kitty.specify "Workspace-per-Work-Package for Parallel Development"
→ Created kitty-specs/010-workspace-per-work-package-for-parallel-development/spec.md
→ Committed to main
→ NO worktree created

/spec-kitty.plan
→ Created plan.md in main
→ Committed to main

/spec-kitty.tasks
→ Created 10 WP files in main
→ Generated dependencies in frontmatter
→ Committed to main
```

### Implementation Phase (worktrees created)

```bash
# WP01 - Foundation
spec-kitty implement WP01
→ Created .worktrees/010-workspace-per-wp-WP01/
→ Branched from main

# WP02, WP03, WP06 - Parallel development (Wave 2)
spec-kitty implement WP02 --base WP01
spec-kitty implement WP03 --base WP01  # Parallel with WP02!
spec-kitty implement WP06               # Independent, parallel!

# Three agents worked simultaneously on WP02, WP03, WP06
```

[Continue with full example...]
```

**Parallel?**: Can write in parallel

---

### Subtask T093 – Update CLAUDE.md development guidelines

**Purpose**: Update project development guidelines (CLAUDE.md) with workspace-per-WP patterns for contributors.

**Steps**:
1. Open `CLAUDE.md` in repository root
2. Add section about workspace-per-WP development:
   ```markdown
   ## Workspace-per-Work-Package Development (0.11.0+)

   ### Planning Workflow

   **All planning happens in main repository:**
   - `/spec-kitty.specify` → Creates kitty-specs/###-feature/ in main
   - `/spec-kitty.plan` → Creates plan.md in main
   - `/spec-kitty.tasks` → Creates tasks/*.md in main
   - All artifacts committed to main before implementation

   **NO worktrees created during planning.**

   ### Implementation Workflow

   **Worktrees created on-demand:**
   - `spec-kitty implement WP01` → Creates .worktrees/###-feature-WP01/
   - One worktree per work package
   - Each WP has isolated workspace

   ### Dependency Handling

   **Declare in WP frontmatter:**
   ```yaml
   dependencies: ["WP01"]  # This WP depends on WP01
   ```

   **Use --base flag:**
   ```bash
   spec-kitty implement WP02 --base WP01  # Branches from WP01
   ```

### Testing Requirements

   **For workspace-per-WP features:**
- Write migration tests for template updates (parametrized across agents)
- Write integration tests for full workflow (specify → implement → merge)
- Write dependency graph tests (cycle detection, validation)

### Agent Template Updates

   **When modifying workflow commands, update ALL 12 agents:**
   [List AGENT_DIRS]

   **Test with migration test:**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/specify_cli/test_workspace_per_wp_migration.py -v
   ```
   ```

3. Update "Recent Changes" section (already done in earlier step)
4. Add any development-specific notes (how to test locally, etc.)

**Files**: `CLAUDE.md`

**Parallel?**: Can write in parallel

---

## Documentation Quality Checklist

**For each documentation file, verify:**
- [ ] Clear, direct language (no jargon without explanation)
- [ ] Step-by-step instructions where applicable
- [ ] Code examples are copy-pasteable
- [ ] Error messages documented with solutions
- [ ] Links to related docs (cross-referencing)
- [ ] Tested by following guide manually

---

## Test Strategy

**Validation Method**: Manual walkthrough

**Test Plan**:
1. Have a fresh user (or reviewer) follow migration guide
2. Verify they can upgrade successfully without assistance
3. Note any confusion points or gaps
4. Revise documentation based on feedback

**Dogfooding**: Use upgrade guide to upgrade a test project from 0.10.12 to 0.11.0, verify all steps work as documented.

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1: Migration guide incomplete**
- Impact: Users stuck during upgrade, frustrated
- Mitigation: Test guide on real project, have peer review documentation

**Risk 2: Breaking change not communicated clearly**
- Impact: Users surprised by upgrade failure, don't understand why
- Mitigation: Prominent warnings in README, CHANGELOG, migration guide

**Risk 3: Examples don't match actual behavior**
- Impact: Users follow examples, commands fail
- Mitigation: Test all examples before documenting, use real commands from actual usage

**Risk 4: Troubleshooting section missing common errors**
- Impact: Users encounter errors not covered in docs
- Mitigation: Collect common errors during implementation, add to troubleshooting

---
