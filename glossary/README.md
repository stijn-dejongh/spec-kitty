# Spec Kitty Living Glossary

Canonical terminology for Spec Kitty. This glossary is a living artifact organized by context domain.

## Source of Truth

When terms conflict, use this order:

1. Accepted product planning docs (PDR/PRD/ADR)
2. This glossary (policy language)
3. Runtime contracts and event logs (operational behavior)

## Architecture Framing

Spec Kitty uses two complementary layers:

1. Policy layer (glossary, specs, ADRs): defines language, intent, and invariants.
2. Runtime layer (CLI/events/projections): executes behavior and records what happened.

Use policy docs to answer "what should this mean?" and runtime artifacts to answer "what did the system do?"

## Status Lifecycle

`candidate` -> `canonical` -> `deprecated` / `superseded`

## Term Entry Schema

Each glossary term table should include:

1. `Definition`
2. `Context`
3. `Status`
4. `Applicable to` (version scope, for example `` `1.x`, `2.x` ``)

## Runtime Anchors (`2.x`)

- `src/specify_cli/glossary/`
- `src/specify_cli/missions/glossary_hook.py`
- `src/specify_cli/missions/primitives.py`
- `src/specify_cli/cli/commands/glossary.py`

## PDR Alignment Notes

- Scoped glossary model: `spec_kitty_core`, `team_domain`, `audience_domain`, `mission_local`
- Strictness modes: `off`, `medium` (default), `max`
- Generation block policy: block unresolved high-severity semantic conflicts only
- History model: append-only glossary evolution events, replayable from canonical logs
