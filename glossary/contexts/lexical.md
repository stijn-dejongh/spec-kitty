## Context: Lexical

Terms describing the glossary's own internal data model — how terms are represented, resolved, and tracked.

### Term Surface

| | |
|---|---|
| **Definition** | The raw text of a domain term as it appears in mission inputs or outputs, before the system determines what it means. For example, the word "agent" is a term surface that could mean different things in different contexts. |

### Term Sense

| | |
|---|---|
| **Definition** | The specific meaning of a term surface within a particular glossary scope. Carries the definition, where it came from (provenance), how confident the system is in it, and whether it's active or deprecated. |

### Provenance

### Confidence Score
