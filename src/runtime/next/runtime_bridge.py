"""Bridge between CLI ``decide_next()`` and the CLI-internal ``_internal_runtime`` engine.

The runtime is now internalized as part of mission
``shared-package-boundary-cutover-01KQ22DS``; production code no longer imports
the standalone ``spec-kitty-runtime`` PyPI package.

Maps the CLI's Decision dataclass to the runtime's NextDecision by:

1. Starting or loading a mission run (persisted under .kittify/runtime/)
2. Delegating step planning to the runtime DAG planner
3. Handling WP-level iteration within "implement" and "review" steps
4. Enforcing CLI-level guards (artifact checks, WP status)
5. Preserving the existing JSON output contract

Run state is stored locally under ``.kittify/runtime/runs/<run_id>/``.
A tracked-mission-to-run compatibility index currently lives at
``.kittify/runtime/feature-runs.json``.

# #2531 DECOMPOSITION IN PROGRESS (mission runtime-bridge-degod-01KX8M1C).
#
# This module is being progressively decomposed from a single ~3800-LOC /
# 62-symbol god module into cohesive, independently-tested seams under
# ``runtime/next/``. Extracted so far:
#
#   runtime_bridge_engine.py   sole home of ``_internal_runtime`` engine /
#                              planner private access (FR-013); also owns the
#                              ``advance_run_state_after_composition`` logic
#                              (former CC23 ``_advance_run_state_after_composition``
#                              body, reduced to <=15) — this module keeps only
#                              a thin residual compat delegate under the same
#                              name so its 8x-patch/9x-attr monkeypatch surface
#                              still intercepts (contracts/compat-surface.md).
#
#   runtime_bridge_retrospective.py   sole home of the self-contained
#                              Confirm.ask-gated retrospective / learning-
#                              capture cluster (FR-006). This module keeps a
#                              native thin compat delegate under each of the 9
#                              symbols the WP02 compat guard binds (see the
#                              seam module's docstring for why a plain
#                              re-export is insufficient here — the guard's
#                              identity check hardcodes the cross-module
#                              baseline).
#
#   runtime_bridge_io.py       sole home of the narrow I/O ports (IC-04):
#                              feature-runs.json index, template/pack
#                              discovery, run lifecycle, the OperationalContext
#                              builder, the FR-009 gather_artifact_presence
#                              fact-port, and the pure resolve_commit_target
#                              lifted out of _wrap_with_decision_git_log. Same
#                              native-thin-delegate rule as the retrospective
#                              seam applies to every compat-tracked symbol
#                              moved there.
#
#   runtime_bridge_cores.py    sole home of the pure, zero-dependency leaves
#                              (FR-009): the tasks.md parse family and the
#                              guard inversion (`evaluate_guards(snapshot)`
#                              folding `_check_cli_guards` /
#                              `_check_composed_action_guard` /
#                              `_check_requirement_mapping_ready`'s decision
#                              tail over the WP05 `ArtifactPresenceSnapshot`
#                              fact-port). Same native-thin-delegate rule for
#                              every compat-tracked symbol moved there; two
#                              symbols (`_parse_wp_sections_from_tasks_md` /
#                              `_parse_requirement_refs_from_tasks_md`) use a
#                              same-module live-lookup between their two
#                              residual delegates rather than forwarding to
#                              the cores-internal call, closing the
#                              intra-seam false-green trap for their mutual
#                              call (see their docstrings below).
#
#   runtime_bridge_cores.py    ALSO owns the Decision-builder (FR-011,
#                              WP07): ``DecisionEnvelope`` + ``step_or_
#                              blocked`` collapse the 29 open-coded
#                              ``Decision(...)`` constructions (+ the 4x
#                              ``_state_to_action -> _build_prompt_or_error
#                              -> step-or-blocked`` triad) that used to be
#                              scattered across this module's three public
#                              entries. This module keeps ``_materialize_
#                              decision`` (the thin residual wrapper
#                              supplying the production ``prompt_exists``
#                              port) plus ``_map_wp_step_decision`` /
#                              ``_map_non_wp_step_decision`` /
#                              ``_build_decision_required_prompt_file``, the
#                              extractions that keep ``_map_runtime_
#                              decision`` / ``query_current_state`` at or
#                              under the complexity ceiling.
#
#   runtime_bridge_composition.py   sole home of the composition-dispatch
#                              cluster (WP08): the dispatch entry
#                              (``_dispatch_via_composition``), the
#                              composed-action guard
#                              (``_check_composed_action_guard``), the
#                              composition-input resolution helpers, the
#                              research/documentation guard-fact readers, and
#                              — the FR-008 headline — the
#                              ``_should_dispatch_via_composition`` selection
#                              seam isolated as a clean, gates-#2535-free
#                              predicate for a future WP14 consumer to route
#                              through. Same native-thin-delegate rule for
#                              every compat-tracked symbol moved there.
#                              ``_advance_run_state_after_composition``
#                              (WP03) is unaffected — its logic already lives
#                              in the engine adapter and its thin residual
#                              delegate stays defined right here, unmoved.
#
#   runtime_bridge_identity.py   sole home of the hottest fracture line
#                              (WP10, LAST): coord-branch naming
#                              (``_resolve_coordination_branch``), mission-ULID
#                              resolution (``_resolve_mission_ulid``), and
#                              primary-feature-dir resolution
#                              (``_primary_runtime_feature_dir``) — the scars
#                              #2091/#1978/#1918/#1814/#2069 cluster. Same
#                              native-thin-delegate rule for every compat-
#                              tracked symbol moved there; both intra-seam
#                              callers of ``_primary_runtime_feature_dir``
#                              (patched 6x) route back through THIS module's
#                              own delegate via a live, deferred lookup rather
#                              than a bare intra-seam call (research.md
#                              §Compat's grounded false-green trap).
#                              ``_wrap_with_decision_git_log`` (the cluster's
#                              caller) and ``_mission_routes_through_
#                              coordination`` are KEEP-IN-PLACE here, unmoved.
#
# This is the FINAL extraction (WP10) — see
# ``kitty-specs/runtime-bridge-degod-01KX8M1C/``.
#
# RULES (do NOT regress):
#   * Never reach into ``_internal_runtime.engine`` / ``.planner`` directly
#     from this module — go through ``runtime_bridge_engine`` (arch-guarded,
#     see ``tests/runtime/test_bridge_engine.py``).
#   * ``__all__`` (below) covers the 8 public names only (governs
#     ``import *``); the ~50 private symbols tests patch stay preserved by the
#     explicit guarded compat re-export block, not by ``__all__`` (FR-012).

    ``next`` entry points, called BEFORE either selects a workspace or starts

    Consumes WP01's :func:`committed_authority.mission_terminal_verdict` —
    the PRIMARY-surface authority (never the coordination checkout) — so a
    merged mission is recognized from committed truth instead of a stale/
    artifact-missing coordination workspace fabricating an unstarted run
    (D9). ``mission_type`` is resolved off the same PRIMARY surface
    (:func:`_primary_runtime_feature_dir`) — never via workspace selection.

    ``terminal_kind`` lets the two callers diverge on the ONE dimension D13
    requires: :func:`decide_next_via_runtime` passes ``DecisionKind.terminal``
    (matching issue #2947's ``--result success`` repro, and creating NO run
    since this returns before workspace selection / ``get_or_start_run``);
    :func:`query_current_state` passes ``DecisionKind.query`` (query mode is
    structurally ``kind: query`` only — mirrors the finalized-override
    ``mission_state="done"`` precedent, :func:`_build_finalized_override_
    query_decision`). A ``blocked_conflict`` verdict honors the same mode
    split: advancing mode emits ``kind: blocked`` (an actionable blocked
    decision), while query mode emits ``kind: query`` with
    ``mission_state="blocked"`` — preserving the query-mode ``is_query`` /
    ``kind: query`` invariant and matching the finalized-override ``blocked:``
    precedent (never ``kind: blocked`` from a read-only query).

    F5 invariant: returns ``None`` for verdict ``"none"`` so the caller's
    existing behavior is BYTE-IDENTICAL to today (protects the many
    in-flight query/decide fixtures) — the only two verdicts this function
    ever materializes a ``Decision`` for are ``"terminal"`` and
    ``"blocked_conflict"``.

    #3829 item 1: the ``"none"`` fall-through also covers the
