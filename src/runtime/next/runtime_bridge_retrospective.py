"""Retrospective / learning-capture seam for ``runtime.next.runtime_bridge`` (#2531 WP04).

**Sole home of the self-contained retrospective/learning-capture cluster**:
``_BufferingRuntimeEmitter``, ``_rich_hic_prompt``, ``_resolve_mission_id_for_terminus``,
``_build_retrospective_facilitator_callback``, ``_resolve_retrospective_policy_for_runtime``,
``_retrospective_blocks_completion``, ``_run_retrospective_learning_capture``,
``_classify_exc``, ``_remediation_hint``, ``_classify_and_emit_failure`` — moved
here verbatim (identical call semantics, C-001) from ``runtime_bridge.py``.

``runtime_bridge.py`` keeps a **native thin compat delegate** under each of the
9 names that the WP02 compat guard binds (``_BufferingRuntimeEmitter``,
``_rich_hic_prompt``, ``_resolve_mission_id_for_terminus``,
``_build_retrospective_facilitator_callback``,
``_resolve_retrospective_policy_for_runtime``,
``_run_retrospective_learning_capture``, ``_classify_exc``,
``_remediation_hint``, ``_classify_and_emit_failure`` — see
contracts/compat-surface.md). This mirrors the WP03 precedent for
``_advance_run_state_after_composition`` ("logic in the adapter, compat shim
in the residual") for a structural reason specific to this guard: the WP02
static guard (``tests/runtime/test_bridge_compat_surface.py::
test_guard_b_identity_reexport_for_relocated_symbols``) asserts the set of
compat symbols whose ``__module__`` differs from ``runtime_bridge`` equals a
**hardcoded 3-element baseline** (the pre-existing ``runtime.next.decision``-
origin symbols). A plain re-export of any of the 9 symbols above would flip
that assertion and fail deterministically — so each stays **natively defined**
in ``runtime_bridge.py`` (a real ``def``/``class`` statement, not an
``import`` alias), forwarding to the implementation here via a live
module-attribute lookup. ``_retrospective_blocks_completion`` is NOT in the
compat guard's tracked symbol set (nothing patches it), so it is re-exported
as a plain module-level import in ``runtime_bridge.py`` instead.

**The retrospective-pair intra-cluster risk (research.md §Compat).** Several
of the 9 compat-guarded symbols call each other (e.g.
``_run_retrospective_learning_capture`` calls
``_build_retrospective_facilitator_callback``; the built facilitator's
``_facilitator`` closure calls ``_classify_and_emit_failure``; that in turn
calls ``_classify_exc``/``_remediation_hint``). Now that the whole cluster
lives together in this module, a bare intra-module call between two of them
would resolve via *this* module's own globals — bypassing a
``monkeypatch.setattr(runtime_bridge, "<name>", …)`` applied to the
``runtime_bridge`` compat delegate (the exact false-green mechanism
contracts/compat-surface.md warns about). Every such intra-cluster call is
therefore routed through a **local, live import of ``runtime_bridge``**
(``from runtime.next import runtime_bridge as _rb; _rb.<name>(...)``,
deferred to function scope to avoid the circular top-level import —
``runtime_bridge`` imports this module at its own top level) so the WP02
compat guard's per-symbol sentinel patches are still observed exactly as
before the extraction. This is the same pattern
``runtime_bridge_engine.py``'s ``_emit_terminal`` already uses to call back
into this cluster (unaffected by this move — it calls ``_rb.<name>``, which
still resolves via the compat delegate regardless of where the real body
lives).

class _BufferingRuntimeEmitter:
    """Records runtime emit calls in order and replays them on flush.

    Used on the legacy DAG dispatch path when the retrospective gate is
    opted in: the engine's ``next_step()`` synchronously calls the
    emitter's ``emit_mission_run_completed`` (and its sync side-effects:
    remote dispatch, queueing, etc.) the moment a terminal advance lands.
    A naive rollback that only restores local files would leave those
    sync events fired and unretractable.

    The buffer captures every emit call in order. After the engine
    returns, the bridge either flushes the buffer to the real emitter
    (gate allowed) or drops it (gate blocked). The ``flush`` is a single
    one-shot replay; subsequent calls flush nothing.

    Implements the ``RuntimeEventEmitter`` Protocol structurally — every
    emit method records ``(method_name, payload)`` and returns ``None``.
