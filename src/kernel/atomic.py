"""Atomic file write utility.

Guarantees: file is either complete old content or complete new content,
never partial. Uses write-to-temp-then-rename on the same filesystem.

Also exposes the canonical *no-op-stable* comparison core (umbrella #1914):
a pure, I/O-free :func:`substantively_equal` that decides whether a freshly
rendered payload differs from existing content *modulo* a caller-supplied
volatile-field projection. Surfaces that re-render tracked files on every run
(charter synthesis, status snapshots, upgrade metadata, ...) share this
comparison so a no-op run leaves the committed bytes untouched and the working
tree clean.

It lives in ``kernel`` (the dependency-free root) rather than
``specify_cli.core`` so the ``charter`` layer can adopt it without crossing the
``charter ↛ specify_cli`` boundary (see
``tests/architectural/test_layer_rules.py`` Invariant 3). specify_cli-level
callers import it directly from ``kernel.atomic``.

Phase 1 (#1914) ships :func:`substantively_equal` with charter synthesis as its
first adopter (via ``src/charter/synthesizer/write_pipeline.py``). A
``write_if_changed`` convenience that gates :func:`atomic_write` on this core —
for byte-comparable writers like status.json (#524) — is deferred to the
Phase-2 convergence so it lands with its first real consumer (the symbol-level
dead-code ratchet forbids shipping it as unwired public surface).

    """Return True if *candidate* equals *existing* for no-op-stability purposes.

    Pure and I/O-free — the canonical comparison core for umbrella #1914. The
    caller is responsible for reading existing content from disk (and for
    deciding what an *absent* file means); this function only compares two
    in-memory payloads.

    Default behaviour (``strip is None``) is a plain byte/text comparison —
    correct for surfaces whose rendered payload carries no volatile fields
    (e.g. status.json snapshots, #524).

    When a ``strip`` projection is supplied, both sides are decoded to text and
    run through ``strip(text, volatile_keys)`` before comparison; equality
    *modulo* the volatile fields then signals a no-op. The projection is
    pluggable precisely so this core bakes in NO format assumptions — charter
    passes its YAML-canonical-line stripper, a future JSON surface could pass a
    structural projection, etc.

    Parameters
    ----------
    existing, candidate:
        The two payloads to compare. ``str`` is compared as text; ``bytes`` is
        compared raw on the default path and decoded as UTF-8 when a ``strip``
        projection is in play.
    volatile_keys:
        Keys handed to the ``strip`` projection. Ignored on the default path.
    strip:
        Optional volatile-field projection. ``None`` ⇒ pure byte/text compare.
