"""Execution-state resolution entry point (canonical surface, internal module).

This is an **internal** submodule of the :mod:`mission_runtime` umbrella. It is
import-forbidden from outside the package — consumers use the symbols re-exported
from :mod:`mission_runtime` only (see ADR 2026-06-07-1 and
``tests/architectural/test_mission_runtime_surface.py``).

WP03 relocates the hardened ``resolve_action_context`` (and its helpers) from
``specify_cli.core.execution_context`` here under the Strangler migration. The
implementation is moved verbatim — this is the single sanctioned resolver
(FR-003/FR-005); behaviour is preserved (NFR-001) and no parallel resolver
survives (NFR-002). The old ``core/execution_context.py`` is removed entirely —
no importers remained after the caller migration, so it is deleted, not shimmed.

Prompts should not discover context on their own. They call into this
command-owned resolver, which determines the active mission, target branch,
work package, workspace path, and any action-specific commands to run.

    ``meta.json`` by the imperative shell) and the shell-assembled fragments, it
    projects exactly one :class:`MissionExecutionContext` through the PURE construction

    **zero** filesystem or git I/O (NFR-005): there is no ``open`` / ``read_text``
    / ``load_meta`` / ``subprocess`` / ``git`` / ``*.exists()`` / ``*.stat()`` /
    ``_assemble_core_fragments`` call in this body — every such read happens in the
    shell BEFORE the resolver and arrives as an argument.

    Placement (C-001 / FR-004 / FR-001b): the destination/placement ref is a
    ref-only :class:`CommitTarget` (C-007) — the coord-routing decision is read
    from the stored ``topology`` via :func:`routes_through_coordination`, never
    from a retired per-ref enum. The supplied ``branch_ref.destination_ref`` is
    carried through unchanged, and the matching
    :class:`ArtifactPlacementFragment` shares that one ``CommitTarget`` (C-PLACE-1).

    :func:`resolve_placement_only`'s narrow-projection *discipline* while sitting
    one layer UP. ``resolve_placement_only`` is the imperative SHELL — it itself
    calls :func:`_assemble_core_fragments` (FS/git) and projects the
    ``destination_ref`` out of those fragments. This resolver does NOT call
    ``_assemble_core_fragments`` or any reader: the shell assembles the fragments
    + reads the stored ``topology`` and threads them in; the resolver projects
    only :func:`build_execution_context`. That separation is what makes the
    zero-fixture purity test possible (T018 / SC-002).

    Optional input-assertion (T016 / C-003 spirit, fail-closed): when the shell
    ALSO supplies the structured ``coordination_branch_signal`` /
    ``has_lanes_signal`` it already read, and the **supplied** ``topology``
    disagrees with what those signals would classify, this raises
    ``ActionContextError("TOPOLOGY_INPUT_MISMATCH", …)`` naming BOTH topologies. It
    is an assertion over shell-provided inputs, NOT a disk re-derivation — the
    resolver stays pure. When the corroborating signals are not supplied the guard
    is skipped cleanly, so pure callers passing only the topology are unaffected.

    Args:
        mission_id: The canonical mission identity (already resolved by the shell).
        topology: The WP02 stored mission topology (authoritative input).
        action: The action name the context is resolved for.

    packages exist yet — so the full :func:`resolve_action_context` cannot be

    ``destination_ref`` :class:`CommitTarget` that builder already computes. The
    topology classification (primary / coordination / flattened) is therefore
    BYTE-IDENTICAL to what the full resolver assembles for the same mission —
    there is no second derivation from ``meta.json`` or git on the planning
    commit path (the #1784 catch-22 root: ``_resolve_planning_branch`` reading
    one authority while the placement fragment reads another).

    This is the literal #1784 fix: on a protected-target repo ``mission create``
    materializes a coordination branch, so the resolved placement is the
    NON-protected coordination ref — a ``GuardCapability.STANDARD`` commit lands
    there cleanly, with no "switch to the lane branch before lanes exist"
    refusal-to-nowhere.

    The projection is now kind-aware (write-surface-coherence WP01, FR-002 /
    FR-004): the READ side (:func:`artifact_home_for`) has routed by kind since
    #2090; this WRITE-side projection now agrees. A ``_PRIMARY_ARTIFACT_KINDS``
    member (spec / data-model / research / checklist / finalized plan /
    tasks-index / WP task / lanes / metadata) resolves to the primary
    ``target_branch`` for EVERY topology shape; every other kind keeps the
    topology-routed ``destination_ref`` (the coordination branch under
    coordination topology, else the target branch). ``kind`` is a REQUIRED
    keyword (DECISION 1): there is no default, so an un-threaded call site fails
    at the type/import level rather than silently flipping coord→primary.

    Args:
        repo_root: Repository root (resolved to the canonical primary root by
            the shared builder, so the result is CWD-invariant).
        mission_slug: The mission directory name / slug.
        kind: The mission artifact kind being placed. REQUIRED — no default;
            its partition membership selects the primary vs topology-routed ref.
        resolver: Optional :class:`MissionResolver` threaded through entry
            canonicalization and the shared builder (WP03, FR-002). ``None``
            preserves historical behaviour.

    Returns:
        The single :class:`CommitTarget` the artifact commits to — the primary

    The ONE shared coord-read guard (coord-commit-integrity SURFACE A #5): returns
    the coordination-surface read dir for ``kind`` when — and only when — the
    mission's STORED topology routes through coordination
    (:func:`routes_through_coordination` over ``COORD`` / ``LANES_WITH_COORD``) AND
    that coordination surface is materialised on disk. Returns ``None`` in every
    coord-less case (``SINGLE_BRANCH`` / ``LANES``) and whenever the coord worktree
    has not been materialised yet — there is no coord surface to read from, so the
    caller falls back to its own primary ``feature_dir`` (or reports "nothing to
    reconcile"). Never materialises the worktree (a read/scan must not have side
    effects).

    Now a THIN ``Path | None`` projection of the affirmative seam
    :func:`resolve_artifact_surface` (WP02 — the surface→filesystem schema root):
    it keeps the ``None``-signal contract its remaining consumers rely on
    (``status.doctor`` / ``cli.commands.review`` — "nothing to reconcile") by
    projecting the stamp: a ``COORD`` stamp yields the coord dir, every other stamp
    yields ``None``. The affirmative-vs-``None`` split lives in the ONE seam; this
    is only its narrowing projection (Directive-044).

    Fail-soft (post-merge safety): a mission whose stored topology still declares
    coordination but whose coordination worktree has already been consolidated away
    (a post-merge review read), an ambiguous handle, or a DELETED coordination
    branch all mean "there is no coordination surface to read from" for a
    ``None``-returning guard — so :class:`CoordinationBranchDeleted` (a
    :class:`StatusReadPathNotFound` subclass), the fail-closed refusals, and
    ambiguity are absorbed to ``None`` here. Callers that need the loud C3
    fail-closed behaviour on ``DELETED`` (the accept-path gates) consume
