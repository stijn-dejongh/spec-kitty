"""Shared write-target degrade helper (FR-005, C-004).

Unifies the ``_mission_meta_exists`` pre-gate and port-resolution logic across
three call sites, extracting a single kind-parameterized helper while preserving
each caller's distinct degrade policy (fail-open vs. fail-closed).

The three callers:
* ``decision_log._resolve_default_target`` (fail-open) — passes a concrete
  ``degrade_ref``; an unresolvable mission returns that ref.
* ``bookkeeping_commit._resolve_bookkeeping_commit_target`` (fail-closed) —
  passes ``degrade_ref=branch`` (which may be ``None``); an unresolvable
  mission with no ``branch`` raises ``ActionContextError``.
* ``status_transition._resolve_write_target`` (WP05, fail-closed) — adds pre-gate; preserves degrade

Resolution is always attempted FIRST regardless of ``degrade_ref`` — a
resolvable mission returns the placement-port target even when the caller
passed ``degrade_ref=None`` (fail-closed callers still get the real target
whenever one exists; ``degrade_ref``/the raise is consulted only once
resolution has genuinely failed). This preserves the pre-WP04 semantics of
the two callers this helper replaces.

See spec: FR-005, C-004; plan IC-06a, IC-06b.

    """Resolve write target via the placement port, or degrade to a caller-supplied ref.

    Unifies port-resolution + the ``_mission_meta_exists`` pre-gate (NOT the degrade
    policy). Each caller supplies its own ``degrade_ref`` so that fail-open vs.
    fail-closed behavior is preserved at the call site.

    Resolution is attempted first: when ``mission_slug`` has a ``meta.json`` and
    ``resolve_placement_only`` succeeds, its target is returned regardless of
    ``degrade_ref`` — including when ``degrade_ref`` is ``None``. ``degrade_ref``
    (or the fail-closed raise) is consulted only once resolution has actually
    failed (no ``meta.json`` yet, or a caught resolution error).

    Args:
        repo_root: Path to the primary git repository.
        mission_slug: The mission slug to resolve.
        kind: The artifact kind (determines partition routing: PRIMARY_METADATA → primary
            ``target_branch``; other kinds → topology-routed destination, e.g. COORD).
        degrade_ref: The ref to return if the mission cannot be resolved (no ``meta.json``
            yet, or an ad-hoc fixture outside a resolvable mission). The caller decides
            the policy: fail-open passes a concrete ref, fail-closed passes ``None`` to
            raise instead of silently degrading.
        terminus_write: Fail-closed WRITE mode (S-C / FR-006 / #4970). When ``True``
            the caller is a terminus WRITE, so this NEVER degrades to ``degrade_ref``
            on a resolution failure (it raises, regardless of ``degrade_ref``), AND —
            once resolution succeeds — it additionally asserts that a coord-routing
            target is a *materialized* coordination surface via
            :func:`assert_coord_write_materialized`, refusing the wrong-surface write
            #4970 exploits. Default ``False`` preserves every existing (fail-open /
            fail-closed-via-``degrade_ref``) caller byte-identically.

    Returns:
        A ``CommitTarget`` resolved for ``kind`` through the placement port, or
        ``CommitTarget(ref=degrade_ref)`` if the mission is not resolvable and
        ``degrade_ref`` is not ``None`` (fail-open, non-``terminus_write`` callers).

    Raises:
        ``ActionContextError`` when the mission cannot be resolved AND either
        ``degrade_ref`` is ``None`` or ``terminus_write`` is ``True`` (fail-closed
        policy — never silently degrades to a null ref, and a terminus write never
        degrades to a caller-supplied ref). When a *caught-set* resolution failure
        (``ActionContextError`` / ``StatusReadPathNotFound`` / ``FileNotFoundError``)
        is what triggered the fail-closed path, the fresh ``ActionContextError``
        raised here preserves that failure's concrete ``error_code`` (or
        ``.code`` for an ``ActionContextError``) and chains it as the cause
        (``from exc``) — mirroring ``mission_runtime.resolution``'s own
        boundary-translation idiom (e.g. ``resolve_action_context`` /
        ``resolve_placement_only``: ``raise ActionContextError(exc.error_code,
        str(exc)) from exc``) — so a data-loss signal like
        ``CoordinationBranchDeleted`` (a ``StatusReadPathNotFound`` subclass)
        never gets flattened into a generic, chain-less error. Only failures
        *outside* the caught set (ambiguous/malformed mission, etc.) propagate
        verbatim. Additionally raises ``ActionContextError`` (code
        ``COORD_WRITE_SURFACE_UNMATERIALIZED``) when ``terminus_write`` is ``True``
        and the resolved coord surface is unmaterialized/unresolved (#4970).

    resolver: ``resolved`` is the target the ONE placement authority already
    produced (C-006).

    No-op unless this is genuinely a coordination-branch write:

    * no primary ``meta.json`` (a stub / ad-hoc fixture / legacy mission) → return
      (nothing to gate — the resolver's own policy already applied);
    * no declared ``coordination_branch``, or ``resolved.ref`` is not that branch
      (a PRIMARY write, a flattened mission, or an E2 CONSOLIDATED write that
      resolves to the Primary Branch) → return;
    * ``MATERIALIZED`` → delegates to the single write authority (research D22,

      is outstanding and is otherwise a no-op;

      caller's job once migrated onto :func:`~specify_cli.coordination.
      coord_seed.establish_coord_write_location` directly; D22 narrows this

      authority, which materializes, then seeds or restores as the state
      machine decides (D22: the former "branch already carries the kind"
      refusal is deliberately REMOVED here — that state is the normal
      post-fix shape, not a stale/forked one).

    Raises ``ActionContextError`` (``COORD_WRITE_SURFACE_UNMATERIALIZED``) only
    for the #4970 remote-only shape: a coord-routing write whose coordination
    worktree is absent AND whose coordination branch is not a local head
    (deleted, or the fresh-clone / CI checkout where it exists only on
    ``origin/<lane>``). Materializing that would fork from the primary branch.

    Research D22 (``establish_coord_write_location`` absorbs the coordination
    write gate, single write authority, C-001): this function used to be "the
    single decision locus for S-C" (FR-006 / #4970) and refused an
    ``UNMATERIALIZED`` local-head branch that already carried committed
    content, misclassifying a normal post-fix mission as a stale/forked head.
    :func:`~specify_cli.coordination.coord_seed.establish_coord_write_location`
    is now that single decision locus; this function is a thin delegate to it
    for the two states where a real decision is needed (``MATERIALIZED`` with
