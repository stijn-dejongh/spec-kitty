"""Execution-state context objects (canonical surface, internal module).

This is an **internal** submodule of the :mod:`mission_runtime` umbrella. It is
import-forbidden from outside the package — consumers use the symbols re-exported
from :mod:`mission_runtime` only (see ADR 2026-06-07-1 and
``tests/architectural/test_mission_runtime_surface.py``).

WP03 grows the hardened context value object into the **doc-09 fragment /
op-composite** model
(``docs/plans/engineering-notes/runtime_and_state_overhaul/09-context-decomposition-model.md``).
``MissionExecutionContext`` is NOT a flat field bag: it is a deep module whose
hidden structure is a set of cohesive, domain-owned **value-object fragments**
(Identity, BranchRef, Workspace, StatusSurface, ArtifactPlacement, PromptSource).
An *operation* assembles only the fragments it needs (the op-composite); the
builder lives in :mod:`mission_runtime.resolution` (doc-09 §5 layer law).

Strangler compatibility (C-004 / NFR-001): the historical flat
:class:`MissionExecutionContext` substrate fields
(``feature_dir`` / ``target_branch`` / ``workspace_path`` / ``branch_name`` /
``execution_mode`` / ``mission_slug``) are preserved verbatim so consumers that
have not yet been converted keep reading the same attributes. The fragments are
*attached* to the same object; nothing is removed. ``ActionContext`` remains a
re-exported alias of the canonical :class:`MissionExecutionContext` name.

Single-derivation invariants (T009 / FR-012 / C-CTX-3): ``mid8`` is derived
**exactly once** (in :class:`IdentityFragment`, as ``mission_id[:8]``) and
``target_branch`` is resolved **exactly once** (carried on
:class:`BranchRefFragment`); no other call site recomputes either value.
