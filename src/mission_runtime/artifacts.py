    """A physical tree a mission artifact resolves to — ``surface`` Sense 2.

    Named ``TopologySurface`` (not bare ``Surface``) because ``surface`` is a
    governed overloaded term: Sense 1 is the agent-facing *tool* surface
    (:class:`specify_cli.tool_surface.enums.ToolSurfaceKind`). See
    ``docs/context/orchestration.md`` and ADR ``2026-07-23-1``.

    ``COORD`` replaces the former ``PLACEMENT`` member: the old name avoided the
    *word* rather than the *concept*. Naming a surface ``COORD`` does NOT breach
    the rule against conditioning behaviour on topology — the label is this
    seam's OUTPUT vocabulary, never a per-call-site branching input. A
    ``if surface is COORD: <inline path derivation>`` at a call site stays
    forbidden.

    The ``str`` mixin keeps ``== "primary"`` comparisons working. Note the
    ``"placement"`` wire value is retired with the member; it was never
    persisted to any mission artifact, so no data migration is implied.

    ``LANE`` / ``CONSOLIDATED`` / ``TEMP`` are declared **with** the
    surface→filesystem translation seam that makes each resolvable
    (:func:`mission_runtime.resolution.translate_surface` — data-model.md
    "TopologySurface", IC-11): every member maps to a real location, so none is a
    phantom. They have no production caller yet — ``CONSOLIDATED`` is wired by the
    consolidation flow (IC-04), ``LANE`` / ``TEMP`` by later work — but the
    seam's totality test (:func:`assert_surface_totality`) exercises every member,
    which is what "declared with the seam, not before it" means.

    ``CONSOLIDATED`` is only meaningful from ``LifecyclePhase.POST_CONSOLIDATION``
    onward (data-model.md); the phase gate belongs to the consolidation consumer,
    not to this vocabulary enum.
