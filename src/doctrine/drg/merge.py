"""Canonical three-layer DRG merge (doctrine-owned).

This module owns the **canonical relationship merge** for the Doctrine
Reference Graph (OQ-2(ii) / C-009). It overlays the built-in DRG with
organisation-tier fragments and an optional project-tier graph, producing a
single merged :class:`~doctrine.drg.models.DRGGraph` whose nodes and edges
carry a declared ``provenance`` field.

Relocated from ``charter.drg`` (mission
``org-doctrine-profile-integrity-activation-closure-01KT1TV1`` WP03). The
merge is pure graph logic and depends only on the ``doctrine`` and ``kernel``
layers — it MUST NOT import from ``charter`` or ``specify_cli`` (layer rule,
``tests/architectural/test_layer_rules.py``). Charter retains the
activation-aware filtering/aggregation (``filter_graph_by_activation``) and
re-exports the public names below so existing ``from charter.drg import …``
call sites keep working.

Provenance semantics (data-model.md §2):

* ``"built-in"`` — built-in layer (Mission A);
* ``"org:<pack_name>"`` — contributed by an :class:`OrgDRGFragment`;
* ``"project"`` — contributed by the project layer.

FR-003 (this WP): an org/project fragment edge whose relation label is not a
canonical :class:`Relation` member (or a known alias) now raises a structured
:class:`UnknownRelationError` instead of being silently dropped. This brings
the org-fragment path to parity with the project-fragment Pydantic path, which
already rejects unknown relations loudly. A valid ``specializes_from`` lineage
edge (WP02 added the enum member) resolves identically across shipped, org, and
project tiers.

class OrgDRGConflict:
    """A typed conflict report for built-in/org/project layer disagreements.

    Per data-model §3:

    * ``edge_override`` — an org fragment edge collides with a built-in edge.
    * ``node_override`` — an org fragment node collides with a built-in node.
    * ``kind_mismatch`` — an org fragment node declares a kind not in the
      8-kind universe (in practice this is caught at validation time by
      ``_OrgDRGNode`` in ``doctrine.drg.org_pack_loader``).
    * ``layer_rule_violation`` — a node body_path / import reaches across
      the architectural layer boundary (C-001 binding).
    * ``unresolved_edge_endpoint`` — FR-010. An edge endpoint names nothing
      the merge can bind: not a node the fragment declares, not a URN whose
      kind prefix is a :class:`NodeKind`, and not a bare id present in any
      already-merged layer. Before WP08 this shape was returned as ``None``
      and dropped without warning or record — ADR ``2026-07-26-3``'s
      silent-drop path.
    * ``ambiguous_edge_endpoint`` — FR-010. A bare endpoint id resolves to
      more than one kind (e.g. both ``directive:x`` and ``tactic:x`` exist).
      Before WP08 the directive interpretation always silently won, because
      an unresolved bare target was minted as ``directive:<id>`` outright.
    * ``malformed_urn`` — FR-010. A URN the bridge would have to mint or
      forward is not syntactically valid
      (``doctrine.drg.models.is_valid_urn``). Before WP08 this escaped as a
      raw ``pydantic_core.ValidationError`` from inside the merge rather than
      as a typed pack error.

    ``target_id`` carries the offending token itself for the three FR-010
    kinds and ``org_value`` the edge/node that declared it — so ``kind`` says
    *why*, ``target_id`` says *which token*, and ``org_value`` says *where*.

    ``resolution_applied`` values:

    * ``hard_fail`` — the merge raises :class:`OrgDRGConflictError`.
    * ``built_in_wins`` — silent precedence (the built-in value is retained).
    * ``project_wins`` — silent precedence (the project value is retained).
    * ``org_override`` — a SAME-KIND org node permissibly substitutes a built-in
      node in place (the org value wins, with a WARNING for operator visibility).
      Non-fatal: the merge does NOT raise. Whether a given repo *tolerates* this
      override is a per-repo governance TEST (see
      ``tests/architectural/test_builtin_override_policy.py``), not a merge-time

    **One policy, both endpoints.** The bridge previously ran two different

    silently dropped) while a target fell back to ``directive:<id>`` (miss → a
    phantom node of an invented kind). That asymmetry is the structural cause
    of the mission's D1, D2, D3 and D5 defects, so it is replaced by a single
    ordered precedence applied to both:

    1. **Fragment-local bare id** — the pack's own node, its nearest scope.
    2. **Fully-qualified URN** — ``<kind>:<id>`` where ``<kind>`` is a
       :class:`NodeKind` member and the whole token is syntactically valid.
       Accepted verbatim: it is unambiguous by construction, and it is exactly
       what ``org_pack_loader._collect_augmentation_edges`` emits.
    3. **Bare id resolvable against the BUILT-IN layer** — matched on the id
       half of a built-in URN, which recovers the *declared* kind instead of
       inventing one. Exactly one match resolves; more than one is ambiguous.

    Rule 3 reads the built-in layer ONLY, never the running merge state. Were
    it to consult earlier fragments, whether a pack's bare cross-pack
    reference resolved would depend on the operator's ``organisation_packs:``
    ordering — an order-dependent graph is a silent-difference generator of
    the same family this mission closes. Cross-pack references must be
    qualified (rule 2), which is order-independent by construction.

    Existence is deliberately NOT required for case 2: a fully-qualified
    endpoint may legitimately name a node contributed by a later layer, and
    dangling-endpoint detection belongs to the DRG validator, not the URN
    minter. What the bridge owes is that it never *invents* a kind and never

    Precedence: project > org > built-in. Operator-authored project doctrine
    may override both built-in and org tiers. When the project layer overrides
    a built-in or org node, a ``logging.warning`` is emitted with the URN +
    original layer so the override is visible in operator output but does not
    block the merge. Use :class:`OrgDRGConflict` records to query overrides
    programmatically.

    Org-tier nodes that collide with a built-in node are resolved by kind:

    * **Same-kind** collision — PERMITTED. The org node substitutes the built-in
      in place (preserving the built-in's inbound/outbound edges, mirroring the
      project-layer override), a ``node_override`` conflict with
      ``resolution_applied='org_override'`` is recorded, and a WARNING is
      emitted. The merge does NOT raise. Whether a given repo *tolerates* this
      override is a per-repo governance TEST
      (``tests/architectural/test_builtin_override_policy.py`` consulting
      ``.kittify/doctrine/replaceable-builtins.yaml``), not a merge prohibition.
    * **Kind-drift** collision (org kind DIFFERS from built-in kind) — hard-fails
      with :class:`OrgDRGConflictError` (``resolution_applied='hard_fail'``). An
      override may replace a built-in's content, never its kind.

    Layer-rule violations (org nodes reaching into ``src/specify_cli/``) always
    hard-fail. An org/project fragment edge with an unrecognised relation label
    raises :class:`UnknownRelationError` (FR-003 — no silent drop).

    FR-010 (WP08): an org edge whose **endpoint** cannot be bound also
    hard-fails, with an ``unresolved_edge_endpoint`` /
    ``ambiguous_edge_endpoint`` / ``malformed_urn`` conflict record naming the
    offending token. Both endpoints obey one resolution policy (see
    :func:`_resolve_edge_endpoint`): fragment-local bare id, then
    fully-qualified URN, then a bare id matched against an already-merged
    layer by its *declared* kind. The bridge no longer drops an unresolvable
    source in silence and no longer invents a ``directive:`` kind for an
    unresolvable target.

    Every node and edge in the returned graph carries a declared ``provenance``
    field readable via ``node.provenance``:

    * ``"built-in"`` — built-in layer (Mission A);
    * ``"org:<pack_name>"`` — contributed by an :class:`OrgDRGFragment`;
    * ``"project"`` — contributed by the project layer.

    Parameters
    ----------
    built_in:
        The built-in DRG. Treated as the source of truth for invariants.
    org_fragments:
        Loaded org-tier fragments in declaration order. Earlier fragments take
        precedence over later ones for org-vs-org collisions (but a built-in
        node always wins regardless).
    project:
        Optional project-tier DRG (``.kittify/doctrine/graph.yaml`` loaded and
        merged elsewhere). When ``None``, the merge collapses to the
        built-in+org case.

    Returns
    -------
    DRGGraph:
        The merged graph. Nodes and edges carry the declared ``provenance`` field.

    Raises
    ------
    OrgDRGConflictError:
        On a layer-rule violation OR a kind-drift built-in collision (org kind
        differs from the built-in kind). A SAME-KIND built-in override does NOT
        raise (it is recorded as an ``org_override`` conflict). The error
        carries the full conflict list; the caller can inspect ``exc.conflicts``.
    UnknownRelationError:
        On an org/project fragment edge with an unrecognised relation label
        (FR-003).
    DuplicateURNError:
        On a duplicate ``asset:`` or ``template:`` URN anywhere across the
        built-in, org, and project layers (FR-008/FR-004, D-04 revised). This
        is a global, order-independent, prefix-scoped check that runs once
        after all three layers are assembled — it does not affect any other
