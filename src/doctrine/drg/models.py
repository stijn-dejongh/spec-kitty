class Relation(StrEnum):
    """Typed edge relations in the DRG.

    Lineage vs. delegation vs. augmentation are three distinct concepts and
    MUST NOT be conflated (FR-001, FR-002):

    - ``SPECIALIZES_FROM`` (lineage): a profile/artifact derives from a parent,
      narrowing or extending it. This is a *static composition* relation used
      for inheritance/specialization (FR-001). It is deliberately separate from
      ``DELEGATES_TO`` so lineage never leaks into runtime handoff traversal.
    - ``DELEGATES_TO`` (delegation): a *runtime handoff* relation -- one agent
      hands work to another at execution time (FR-002). It is never inferred
      from lineage.
    - ``ENHANCES`` / ``OVERRIDES`` (augmentation pair, FR-014, mission
      ``charter-ux-and-org-pack-vocabulary-01KSAF14``): a pack artifact declares
      ``enhances: <id>`` to field-merge into a built-in, or ``overrides: <id>``
      to declare a full replacement.
    - ``REPLACES`` is retained for backward compatibility with existing
      hand-authored fragments (R-2).
    - ``REFINES`` (refinement, #2079): an artifact narrows or sharpens the
      applicability or meaning of the target (a parent or built-in) without
      replacing it. It is distinct from ``APPLIES`` (an action applies a
      directive/tactic) and from ``SPECIALIZES_FROM`` (static profile/artifact
      lineage): a refinement is a first-class, traversable relation, never a
      synonym for ``APPLIES``. Previously the org→DRG bridge silently downgraded
      ``refines`` to ``APPLIES`` (a dead sink); it is now preserved end-to-end.
    - ``IN_TENSION_WITH`` / ``RECONCILES_TENSION`` / ``REJECTS`` (tension
      vocabulary, mission ``doctrine-tension-edges-01KY1WPC``, FR-001/002/003):
      three distinct relations that must not be confused with each other or
      with the relations above.

      - ``IN_TENSION_WITH`` is **symmetric and non-transitive**: two co-valid,
        co-activatable artefacts compete on the same decision, and neither is
        deprecated by the other. It is stored as a single canonical edge
        (lexicographically-smaller URN as source, C-002) and queried from
        either endpoint via :meth:`DRGGraph.edges_from`/:meth:`DRGGraph.edges_to`.
        It must NOT be confused with ``REPLACES``/supersession -- tension does
        not mean one side wins or is retired.
      - ``RECONCILES_TENSION`` is **directional**, from an active
        reconciliation artefact to one side of a tension pair. A pair counts
        as resolved only when an active artefact carries this edge to BOTH
        sides; a single edge to one side leaves the pair "half-reconciled"
        and still flagged (FR-002). It is never synthesized from
        ``IN_TENSION_WITH`` -- it must be authored explicitly.
      - ``REJECTS`` is **directional**, from a good artefact to a marked
        anti-pattern/smell node (``NodeKind.ANTI_PATTERN``). Unlike
        ``IN_TENSION_WITH`` the target is not a competing equal -- it is a
        named bad practice, not a co-valid rule -- and unlike ``REPLACES`` the
        target was never a valid rule the rejecting artefact supersedes.
