"""Org-tier governance-profile scope-edge extraction (#3629, WP03 / T014).

Built-in mission types project their type-wide ``governance-profile.yaml``
``selected_*`` selections into ``mission_type --scope--> <artifact>`` DRG edges
via
:func:`doctrine.drg.migration.extractor.extract_governance_profile_scope_edges`.
Org packs carry the SAME governance grain at a DIFFERENT path shape --
``<pack_root>/mission_types/<type>/governance-profile.yaml`` (per
``charter.mission_type_profiles._resolve_governance_slot``) -- which no
extraction pass ever read. So an org-tier ``selected_*`` typo reached no DRG
edge at all: it was neither minted (the built-in extractor globs only the
built-in missions root) nor guarded (a total no-op, not even a silent prune).

This module reads that org-tier path and returns the scope-edge selections so
they enter the merged DRG through the org-pack fragment path
(:func:`doctrine.drg.org_pack_loader.load_org_pack`). The post-merge fail-loud
guard that escalates an unresolved selection to an error lives in
:func:`doctrine.drg.validator.assert_governance_scope_resolves` (it cannot live
here: a pre-merge single-pack read cannot see built-in targets, so it would
false-positive on every legitimate reference into the built-in layer -- squad
finding G1).

The ``selected_*`` field -> target-kind mapping is IMPORTED from the built-in
extractor
(:data:`~doctrine.drg.migration.extractor._GOVERNANCE_PROFILE_SCOPE_FIELDS`),
never copied: a hand-copy would be a second source of truth for the one table
(the exact drift this mission removes -- squad finding G2).
