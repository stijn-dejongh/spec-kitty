#: Ordered list of (compiled-pattern, kind) pairs.  Each pattern captures the
#: filename stem (without kind extension and without any subdirectory prefix) in
#: group 1.  The ``(?:.+/)?`` non-capturing optional subdir fragment ensures that
#: both flat paths (``<kind>/foo.tactic.yaml``) and paths rooted under a
#: subdirectory (``<kind>/testing/foo.tactic.yaml``) resolve to the same stem.
#:
#: **Two path shapes are matched (relocate-builtin-doctrine-packs).** The flatten
#: (WP03) moved artifact *files* from ``src/doctrine/<kind>/built-in/`` to the
#: flattened ``packs/built-in/<kind>/``, but the ``references:`` path strings
#: authored *inside* the styleguide/toolguide YAML were deliberately **not**
#: rewritten (that move was a pure ``git mv`` — no in-file edits). Those strings
#: are the actual input :func:`_resolve_path_ref` reads, so the legacy
#: ``src/doctrine/<kind>/built-in/`` branch is load-bearing: dropping it would
#: silently lose every reference-derived ``suggests`` edge and shrink the shipped
#: graph. The flattened ``packs/built-in/<kind>/`` branch (inner ``built-in``
#: dropped) resolves any reference authored in the new home. A path string
#: resolves via **either** branch to the same ``(kind, stem)`` because the URN is
#: keyed on the stem, not the prefix — so the graph is prefix-invariant.
#:
#: Only **built-in** artifact directories are covered; ``_proposed`` profiles and
#: non-artifact files (README, glossary YAML, URLs) will not match any pattern
#: and therefore return ``None`` from :func:`_resolve_path_ref`.

    loss, not a triple change, and no golden-count update was required for THAT
