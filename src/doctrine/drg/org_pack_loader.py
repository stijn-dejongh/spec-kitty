"""Doctrine-layer org-pack schema and per-pack loader (Slice F WP06 / DDD boundary).

This module is the canonical home for the org-pack on-disk schema.  It was
split out of ``charter.drg`` per the PR #1119 pre-review comment: org-pack
schema knowledge belongs in the ``doctrine`` layer so it cannot silently
drift from the main DRG schema as ``doctrine`` evolves.

Architectural boundary
----------------------

``doctrine`` sits below ``charter`` in the dependency hierarchy::

    kernel (root) <- doctrine <- charter <- specify_cli

This module MUST NOT import from ``charter`` or ``specify_cli``. Charter
reads ``organisation_packs:`` from ``.kittify/config.yaml`` (project-config
knowledge, charter-domain) and calls :func:`load_org_pack` for each
configured pack root. All per-pack parsing and schema validation is the
doctrine domain's responsibility and lives here.

C-009 / kind universe
---------------------

The 8-kind plural universe (``_ORG_DRG_CANONICAL_KINDS``) is declared here
rather than imported from elsewhere so that any drift from
``charter.activations._ALLOWED_KINDS`` is surfaced by the contract test
sweep (C-009 binding). Do not import this constant across the boundary;
use the contract sweep to detect drift.

# Mission ``charter-doctrine-mission-type-configuration-01KSWJVX`` (WP01 + WP11)
# renames ``mission_step_contracts`` → ``mission_steps`` as the canonical plural
# kind, aligning the DRG with the runtime domain model in
# ``doctrine.missions.models.MissionStep``. The legacy plural is preserved as
# an alias for one release so that org packs authored against the previous
# universe continue to validate; the alias resolves to the same canonical
# kind on parse, so downstream code only sees the canonical form.

#: Canonical plural-kind alias map. Keys = forms accepted on input; values =
#: canonical form retained on the validated node. Identity entries (canonical
#: → canonical) keep ``_ORG_DRG_CANONICAL_KINDS`` semantics intact.
# DIRECTIVE_003 (FR-032, decision locked): mission-type augmentation is
# delivered by EXPANDING this canonical kind universe to include mission types,
# NOT by a separate augmentation path. The plural ``mission_types`` is added to
# the universe and to ``_ORG_DRG_KIND_ALIASES`` so an org-pack fragment may
# author ``enhances`` / ``overrides`` / ``specializes_from`` edges against a
# built-in mission type and have them validate. This is a binding change to the
# (formerly 8-kind) universe; the lockstep drift guard against
# ``charter.activations._ALLOWED_KINDS`` lives in
# ``tests/doctrine/test_org_pack_augmentation.py`` (it asserts the loader
# universe equals ``_ALLOWED_KINDS`` plus the mission-type extension, so neither
# side can drift silently and mission types are never silently dropped).

    field):

    * ``mode == Relation.OVERRIDES`` — full replacement: the overlay is
      returned as-is (validated by the caller's schema). The base is discarded.
    * ``mode == Relation.ENHANCES`` — field-level merge: overlay fields replace
      same-named base fields; fields absent from the overlay fall through to the
      base. The **action sequence** (``steps`` / ``actions``) is the topology
      backbone: if the overlay omits it, the base ordering is preserved
