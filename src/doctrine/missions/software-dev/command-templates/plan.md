# /spec-kitty.plan - Create Implementation Plan

**Version**: 0.11.0+

## 📍 WORKING DIRECTORY: Stay in planning repository

**IMPORTANT**: Plan works in the planning repository. NO worktrees created.

```bash
# Run from project root (same directory as /spec-kitty.specify):
# You should already be here if you just ran /spec-kitty.specify

# Creates:
# - kitty-specs/###-mission/plan.md → In planning repository
# - Commits to target branch
# - NO worktrees created
```

**Do NOT cd anywhere**. Stay in the planning repository root.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Constitution Context Bootstrap (required)

Before planning interrogation, load constitution context for this action:

```bash
spec-kitty constitution context --action plan --json
```

- If JSON `mode` is `bootstrap`, apply JSON `text` as first-run governance context and follow referenced docs as needed.
- If JSON `mode` is `compact`, continue with condensed governance context.

## Location Check (0.11.0+)

This command runs in the **planning repository**, not in a worktree.

- Verify you're on the target branch (meta.json → target_branch) before scaffolding plan.md
- Planning artifacts live in `kitty-specs/###-mission/`
- The plan template is committed to the target branch after generation

**Path reference rule:** When you mention directories or files, provide either the absolute path or a path relative to the project root (for example, `kitty-specs/<mission>/tasks/`). Never refer to a folder by name alone.

## Planning Interrogation (mandatory)

Before executing any scripts or generating artifacts you must interrogate the specification and stakeholders.

- **Scope proportionality (CRITICAL)**: FIRST, assess the mission's complexity from the spec:
  - **Trivial/Test Missions** (hello world, simple static pages, basic demos): Ask 1-2 questions maximum about tech stack preference, then proceed with sensible defaults
  - **Simple Missions** (small components, minor API additions): Ask 2-3 questions about tech choices and constraints
  - **Complex Missions** (new subsystems, multi-component missions): Ask 3-5 questions covering architecture, NFRs, integrations
  - **Platform/Critical Missions** (core infrastructure, security, payments): Full interrogation with 5+ questions

- **User signals to reduce questioning**: If the user says "use defaults", "just make it simple", "skip to implementation", "vanilla HTML/CSS/JS" - recognize these as signals to minimize planning questions and use standard approaches.

- **First response rule**:
  - For TRIVIAL missions: Ask ONE tech stack question, then if answer is simple (e.g., "vanilla HTML"), proceed directly to plan generation
  - For other missions: Ask a single architecture question and end with `WAITING_FOR_PLANNING_INPUT`

- If the user has not provided plan context, keep interrogating with one question at a time.

- **Conversational cadence**: After each reply, assess if you have SUFFICIENT context for this mission's scope. For trivial missions, knowing the basic stack is enough. Only continue if critical unknowns remain.

Planning requirements (scale to complexity):

1. Maintain a **Planning Questions** table internally covering questions appropriate to the mission's complexity (1-2 for trivial, up to 5+ for platform-level). Track columns `#`, `Question`, `Why it matters`, and `Current insight`. Do **not** render this table to the user.
2. For trivial missions, standard practices are acceptable (vanilla HTML, simple file structure, no build tools). Only probe if the user's request suggests otherwise.
3. When you have sufficient context for the scope, summarize into an **Engineering Alignment** note and confirm.
4. If user explicitly asks to skip questions or use defaults, acknowledge and proceed with best practices for that mission type.

## Outline

1. **Check planning discovery status**:
   - If any planning questions remain unanswered or the user has not confirmed the **Engineering Alignment** summary, stay in the one-question cadence, capture the user's response, update your internal table, and end with `WAITING_FOR_PLANNING_INPUT`. Do **not** surface the table. Do **not** run the setup command yet.
   - Once every planning question has a concrete answer and the alignment summary is confirmed by the user, continue.

2. **Detect mission context** (CRITICAL - prevents wrong mission selection):

   Before running any commands, detect which mission you're working on:

   a. **Check branch context**:
      - Run: `spec-kitty agent mission branch-context --json`
      - Use the returned JSON to identify the current branch and mission context

   b. **Check current directory**:
      - Look for `###-mission-name` pattern in the current path
      - Examples:
        - Inside `kitty-specs/020-my-mission/` → Mission `020-my-mission`
        - Not in a worktree during planning (worktrees only used during implement): If detection runs from `.worktrees/020-my-mission-WP01/` → Mission `020-my-mission`

   c. **Prioritize missions without plan.md** (if multiple exist):
      - If multiple missions exist and none detected from branch/path, list all missions in `kitty-specs/`
      - Prefer missions that don't have `plan.md` yet (unplanned missions)
      - If ambiguous, ask the user which mission to plan

   d. **Extract mission slug**:
      - Mission slug format: `###-mission-name` (e.g., `020-my-mission`)
      - You MUST pass this explicitly to the setup-plan command using `--mission` flag
      - **DO NOT** rely on auto-detection by the CLI (prevents wrong mission selection)

3. **Setup**: Run `spec-kitty agent mission setup-plan --mission <mission-slug> --json` from the repository root and parse JSON for:
   - `result`: "success" or error message
   - `plan_file`: Absolute path to the created plan.md
   - `mission_dir`: Absolute path to the mission directory

   **Example**:

   ```bash
   # If detected mission is 020-my-mission:
   spec-kitty agent mission setup-plan --mission 020-my-mission --json
   ```

   **Error handling**: If the command fails with "Cannot detect mission" or "Multiple missions found", verify your mission detection logic in step 2 and ensure you're passing the correct mission slug.

4. **Load context**: Read MISSION_SPEC and `.kittify/constitution/constitution.md` if it exists. If the constitution file is missing, skip Constitution Check and note that it is absent. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).

5. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template, using the validated planning answers as ground truth:
   - Update Technical Context with explicit statements from the user or discovery research; mark `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: …]` only when the user deliberately postpones a decision
   - If a constitution exists, fill Constitution Check section from it and challenge any conflicts directly with the user. If no constitution exists, mark the section as skipped.
   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified or questions remain unanswered)
   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (commission research to resolve every outstanding clarification)
   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md based on confirmed intent
   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script
   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design, asking the user to resolve new gaps before proceeding

6. **STOP and report**: This command ends after Phase 1 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.

   **⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT proceed to task generation!** The user must explicitly run `/spec-kitty.tasks` to generate work packages. Your job is COMPLETE after reporting the planning artifacts.

## Phases

### Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
      Task: "Research {unknown} for {mission context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete

1. **Extract entities from mission spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Agent context update**:
   - Run `{AGENT_SCRIPT}`
   - These scripts detect which AI agent is in use
   - Update the appropriate agent-specific context file
   - Add only new technology from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## ⛔ MANDATORY STOP POINT

**This command is COMPLETE after generating planning artifacts.**

After reporting:

- `plan.md` path
- `research.md` path (if generated)
- `data-model.md` path (if generated)
- `contracts/` contents (if generated)
- Agent context file updated

**YOU MUST STOP HERE.**

Do NOT:

- ❌ Generate `tasks.md`
- ❌ Create work package (WP) files
- ❌ Create `tasks/` subdirectories
- ❌ Proceed to implementation

The user will run `/spec-kitty.tasks` when they are ready to generate work packages.

**Next suggested command**: `/spec-kitty.tasks` (user must invoke this explicitly)
