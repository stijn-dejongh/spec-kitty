class InlineReferenceRejectedError(ValueError):
    """Raised when a doctrine artifact YAML carries a forbidden inline reference field.

    The legacy governance model allowed artifacts to carry inline reference
    arrays such as ``tactic_refs``, ``paradigm_refs``, or ``applies_to``.
    Post-WP02 of the ``excise-doctrine-curation-and-inline-references-01KP54J6``
    mission (EPIC #461, Phase 1), the only legal reference channel is the
    DRG edge set in ``src/doctrine/*.graph.yaml``. Per-kind validators reject
    any remaining inline reference with this error.

    See ``contracts/validator-rejection-error.schema.json`` for the
    structured shape.

    Attributes:
        file_path: Absolute path of the offending YAML file (string form).
        forbidden_field: One of ``"tactic_refs"``, ``"paradigm_refs"``,
            ``"applies_to"``.
        artifact_kind: One of ``"directive"``, ``"tactic"``, ``"procedure"``,
            ``"paradigm"``, ``"styleguide"``, ``"toolguide"``, ``"agent_profile"``.
        migration_hint: Operator-facing text matching the schema pattern
            ``"Remove <field> from YAML; add edge {source: <kind>:<id>,
            target: <target-kind>:<target-id>, relation: requires} to
            src/doctrine/<kind>.graph.yaml"``. The named file is the DRG
            fragment for the source artifact's kind -- edges shard by source
            kind, and #2680 replaced the former single monolith with those
            per-kind fragments. Uses the actual ``DRGEdge`` schema
            (``source``/``target``/``relation``) and the ``requires`` relation
            (the ``Relation`` enum does not include ``uses``).
