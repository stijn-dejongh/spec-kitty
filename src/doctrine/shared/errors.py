"""Shared helpers for validator rejection of forbidden inline reference fields.

Introduced in WP03 of the
``excise-doctrine-curation-and-inline-references-01KP54J6`` mission (EPIC
#461, Phase 1). See
``kitty-specs/excise-doctrine-curation-and-inline-references-01KP54J6/contracts/validator-rejection-error.schema.json``
for the error-shape contract and the required ``migration_hint`` pattern.

The canonical ``migration_hint`` string must match::

    ^Remove .+ from YAML; add edge \\{source: .+, target: .+, relation: requires\\}
     to src/doctrine/[a-z_]+\\.graph\\.yaml$

The trailing path is the DRG fragment for the *source* artifact's kind, which
is where an edge with that source belongs. Mission #2680 sharded the former
single doctrine-graph monolith into one ``<kind>.graph.yaml`` fragment per
kind, so a hint naming the monolith sent the operator to a file that is not
there.

The hint uses the actual ``DRGEdge`` schema: ``source``/``target``/``relation``
keys (not ``from``/``to``/``kind``), and ``requires`` as the relation value (the
``Relation`` enum does not contain ``uses``). Callers in the charter resolver
use ``{Relation.REQUIRES, Relation.SUGGESTS}`` for legacy parity, so
``requires`` is the canonical relation for "this artifact needs that one"
patterns.

Any code that raises :class:`InlineReferenceRejectedError` should build the
hint via :func:`build_migration_hint` to keep the textual shape consistent.
