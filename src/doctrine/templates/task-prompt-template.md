## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Review Feedback

**Read this first if you are implementing this task!**

- **Has review feedback?**: Check the `review_ref` field in the event log (via `spec-kitty agent status` or the Activity Log below).
- **You must address all feedback** before your work is complete. Feedback items are your implementation TODO list.
- **Report progress**: As you address each feedback item, update the Activity Log explaining what you changed.

---

## Review Feedback

> **Populated by `/spec-kitty.review`** – Reviewers add detailed feedback here when work needs changes. Implementation must address every item listed below before returning for re-review.

*[This section is empty initially. Reviewers will populate it if the work is returned from review. If you see feedback here, treat each item as a must-do before completion.]*

## ⚠️ Dependency Rebase Guidance

**If this WP depends on other WPs** (check frontmatter `dependencies:` field):

When a parent WP changes during review:

1. You'll need to rebase your workspace to get latest changes
2. Command: `cd .worktrees/{{mission_slug}}-{{work_package_id}} && git rebase {{mission_slug}}-{{base_wp_id}}`
3. Resolve any conflicts
4. Continue work on updated foundation

**Check if rebase needed**:

```bash
cd .worktrees/{{mission_slug}}-{{work_package_id}}
git log --oneline main..{{base_branch}}  # Shows commits in base not in your workspace
```

**If this WP has dependent WPs** (other WPs depend on this one):

When you make changes:

1. Notify agents working on dependent WPs
2. They'll need to rebase their workspaces to get your changes
3. This is a git limitation - future jj integration will auto-rebase

The `spec-kitty implement` command will display warnings when:

- You resume work and the base has changed
- You start work and other WPs depend on you

## Objectives & Success Criteria

- Summarize the exact outcomes that mark this work package complete.
- Call out key acceptance criteria or success metrics for the bundle.

## Context & Constraints

- Reference prerequisite work and related documents.
- Link to supporting specs: `.kittify/constitution/constitution.md`, `kitty-specs/.../plan.md`, `kitty-specs/.../tasks.md`, data model, contracts, research, quickstart.
- Highlight architectural decisions, constraints, or trade-offs to honor.

## Subtasks & Detailed Guidance

### Subtask TXXX – Replace with summary

- **Purpose**: Explain why this subtask exists.
- **Steps**: Detailed, actionable instructions.
- **Files**: Canonical paths to update or create.
- **Parallel?**: Note if this can run alongside others.
- **Notes**: Edge cases, dependencies, or data requirements.

### Subtask TYYY – Replace with summary

- Repeat the structure above for every included `Txxx` entry.

## Test Strategy (include only when tests are required)

- Specify mandatory tests and where they live.
- Provide commands or scripts to run.
- Describe fixtures or data seeding expectations.

## Risks & Mitigations

- List known pitfalls, performance considerations, or failure modes.
- Provide mitigation strategies or monitoring notes.

## Review Guidance

- Key acceptance checkpoints for `/spec-kitty.review`.
- Any context reviewers should revisit before approving.

## Activity Log

> **CRITICAL**: Activity log entries MUST be in chronological order (oldest first, newest last).

### How to Add Activity Log Entries

**When adding an entry**:

1. Scroll to the bottom of this Activity Log section
2. **APPEND the new entry at the END** (do NOT prepend or insert in middle)
3. Use exact format: `- YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ – agent_id – <action>`
4. Timestamp MUST be current time in UTC (check with `date -u "+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"`)
5. Agent ID should identify who made the change (claude-sonnet-4-5, codex, etc.)

**Format**:

```
- YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ – <agent_id> – <brief action description>
```

**Example (correct chronological order)**:

```
- 2026-01-12T10:00:00Z – system – Prompt created
- 2026-01-12T10:30:00Z – claude – Started implementation
- 2026-01-12T11:00:00Z – codex – Implementation complete, ready for review
- 2026-01-12T11:30:00Z – claude – Review passed, all tests passing  ← LATEST (at bottom)
```

**Common mistakes (DO NOT DO THIS)**:

- Adding new entry at the top (breaks chronological order)
- Using future timestamps (causes acceptance validation to fail)
- Inserting in middle instead of appending to end

**Why this matters**: The acceptance system reads the LAST activity log entry as the current state. If entries are out of order, acceptance will fail even when the work is complete.

**Initial entry**:

- {{TIMESTAMP}} – system – Prompt created.

### Updating Status

Status is managed via `status.events.jsonl`. Use `spec-kitty agent tasks move-task <WPID> --to <status>` to change WP status.

### File Structure

All WP files live in a flat `tasks/` directory.
