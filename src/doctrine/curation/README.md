# Governance Curation

This directory is the pull-based curation entry point for external practices.

## Intent

Capture useful external approaches, tactics, and related doctrine ideas, then
adapt and integrate them into Spec Kitty doctrine so agentic workflows can use
validated, project-aligned guidance.

## Process

1. Register the external source in `imports/<source-id>/manifest.yaml`.
2. Create one candidate file per imported concept in `imports/<source-id>/candidates/*.import.yaml`.
3. Capture provenance in candidate `source` fields (title, type, publisher, URL/path, accessed date).
4. Add `source_references` with traceable local citations (`path`, `lines`, `note`) to support later DRY extraction.
5. Add `external_references` for attribution when needed. Mark these as attribution-only (`extraction_action: none`) because they do not drive doctrine extraction directly.
6. Classify each candidate to doctrine targets (`tactic`, `directive`, etc.) and document rationale.
7. Record adaptation notes that translate source language into Spec Kitty terminology and constraints.
8. Curate the concept into doctrine artifacts (for example `src/doctrine/tactics/*.tactic.yaml`).
9. Update related directives to link curated tactics (for example `tactic_refs` in `TEST_FIRST`).
10. Mark candidate status through review to `adopted`, and ensure `resulting_artifacts` points to created doctrine files.
11. Re-run schema and curation validation to confirm the import is machine-valid.

## Candidate Template

Use `src/doctrine/curation/import-candidate.template.yaml` as the canonical scaffold for new candidates.

## Agent-Profile Adaptation Mapping

When an import candidate targets `agent-profile`, use this field mapping to
translate `.agent.md` source files into `.agent.yaml` doctrine artifacts.

| `.agent.md` source | `.agent.yaml` target |
|---|---|
| YAML frontmatter | Top-level profile fields |
| `## 1. Context Sources` | `context-sources:` |
| `## Directive References` table | `directive-references:` list |
| `## 2. Purpose` | `purpose:` scalar |
| `## 3. Specialization` | `specialization:` object |
| `## 4. Collaboration Contract` | `collaboration:` object |
| `## 5. Mode Defaults` table | `mode-defaults:` list |
| `## 6. Initialization Declaration` | `initialization-declaration:` scalar |

Validate the resulting `.agent.yaml` with:

```bash
python -c "
from doctrine.agent_profiles.validation import validate_agent_profile_yaml
from ruamel.yaml import YAML
yaml = YAML(typ='safe')
with open('path/to/profile.agent.yaml') as f:
    data = yaml.load(f)
errors = validate_agent_profile_yaml(data)
print('Valid' if not errors else errors)
"
```

## Example Journey: ZOMBIES TDD

A lead developer reads about ZOMBIES TDD and wants implementation agents to use
it by default.

1. Add a candidate under `imports/<source>/candidates/`.
2. Classify to one or more doctrine concepts (for example `tactic`).
3. Add adaptation notes (terminology + constraints).
4. Add source references for every extracted idea.
5. Mark candidate `adopted` after review.
6. Add resulting artifact links (for example `src/doctrine/tactics/...`).

Adoption without resulting artifact links is invalid.
