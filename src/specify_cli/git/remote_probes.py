"""Single canonical tri-state remote-branch-existence primitive (#4979, C-001).

Two remote-branch probes shipped independently before this module existed:
``coordination.surface_resolver._coord_branch_exists`` (the ``refs/remotes/``
fast path only — never consulted the remote itself) and
``cli.commands.mission_type._branch_resolvable`` (a hand-rolled
``git remote`` + ``git ls-remote --heads`` loop, with no ``timeout=``, so an
unreachable/prompting remote could hang the CLI). C-001 forbids a third
parallel probe: :func:`remote_branch_lookup` is the ONE shared primitive both
sites are refactored onto (WP01 T003/T004) — any future remote-branch check
must consume it rather than hand-rolling another ``git remote`` /
``git ls-remote`` loop.

Discriminates three ``git ls-remote --heads`` outcomes across every
configured remote:

* :attr:`RemoteLookup.HIT` — at least one remote lists the branch.
* :attr:`RemoteLookup.CLEAN_MISS` — every remote answered (exit 0) with no
  match — a reachable "the branch really is not there".
* :attr:`RemoteLookup.ERROR` — at least one remote errored, timed out, or
  otherwise could not be asked cleanly — the network condition is
  inconclusive, so the caller must fail closed (NFR-002); a MISS from one
  remote never overrides an ERROR from another.
* :attr:`RemoteLookup.NO_REMOTE` — zero remotes are configured at all: there
  is no remote authority to consult, so the caller retains local-only
  authority instead of treating this as either HIT or CLEAN_MISS.

Fails closed toward :attr:`RemoteLookup.ERROR` on any git-unreadable
condition (unparseable ``git remote`` output never happens in practice, but
an ``OSError`` launching git, a non-zero ``git remote`` exit, a
``subprocess.TimeoutExpired``, or a non-zero ``ls-remote`` exit all resolve
here). ``GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`` and SSH ``BatchMode=yes`` prevent a
credential prompt from ever blocking the CLI (NFR-002); a bounded
``timeout=`` prevents an unreachable remote from hanging it.

The lookup is memoized per-process, keyed ``(repo_root, branch)`` (NFR-001):
a single-branch/CI coordination checkout never materializes the coord
worktree, so an unmemoized probe would re-fire the network arm on every coord
read within one CLI invocation. Call :func:`_reset_remote_branch_lookup_cache`
between independent probes in the same process (tests only — production never
needs to invalidate the cache within one invocation).
