"""Safe commit helper with destination-ref-aware HEAD assertion.

This module provides utilities for committing only specific files without
capturing unrelated staged changes, while structurally enforcing that the
commit lands on the branch the caller declared.

Contract (post-#1348 / mission ``mission-coordination-branch-atomic-event-log``)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

``safe_commit()`` requires a **keyword-only** ``destination_ref`` (the short
branch name, never ``refs/heads/<name>``) and a ``worktree_root`` path. Before
any staging or commit, the helper asserts that the worktree's ``HEAD`` matches
``destination_ref``. There is **no silent fallback** path that infers the
destination from the current working directory or HEAD --- a missing argument
fails ``mypy --strict``, and a mismatched HEAD raises ``SafeCommitHeadMismatch``.

This is the structural invariant that makes every caller correct-by-construction.
Policy can no longer drift from physical staging because policy and physical
target are checked against each other at the chokepoint.

Every exception below carries a stable ``error_code`` (NFR-007) for scripted
detection, plus ``destination_ref`` and (where relevant) ``observed_head`` and
``worktree_root`` so operators and CI tooling can act on structured data.

Staging-area data-loss backstop
-------------------------------

In addition to the destination-ref invariant, every ``safe_commit`` call still
asserts that the staging area contains exactly the paths the caller requested
before the commit is created. If any unexpected path is staged (for example, a
phantom deletion produced by a sparse-checkout filter interacting with
``git stash pop``), the commit is aborted with ``SafeCommitBackstopError``. The
backstop is unconditional and cannot be bypassed via any ``--force`` code path
--- see Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty#588 for the cascade it defends against.

Protected-branch authorization policy (FR-008)
----------------------------------------------

A commit may land on a protected branch ONLY when the caller asserts a
protected-flow :class:`~specify_cli.core.commit_guard.GuardCapability` at the
call site (``release_flow`` / ``upgrade_bookkeeping`` / ``merge_bookkeeping`` /
``test_mode``). The decision is made solely by ``commit_guard.evaluate`` —
authorization is asserted-at-the-surface, never derived from commit-message
text, committed-file content, or ambient environment.

WP03 DELETED the historical privilege channels that used to grant this implicitly:

- the message-prefix allowlist (``release: ``/``chore: …`` etc.) — the upgrade,
  release, and merge-bookkeeping flows now pass an explicit capability;
- the two ``allow_*`` protected-branch bool parameters and the op-record JSONL
  file-content exception — folded into ``GuardCapability.test_mode`` /
  ``merge_bookkeeping``;
- the ``SPEC_KITTY_TEST_MODE`` env privilege hatch.

The ONE retained operator escape hatch,
``SPEC_KITTY_ALLOW_PROTECTED_BRANCH_COMMITS`` (for solo-fork operators who own
``main``), is consumed by the protected-branch pre-checks AND by
``safe_commit``'s ``ProtectionState`` input computation — the operator declares
the branch unprotected for this repo. ``commit_guard.evaluate`` itself never
reads the environment.

Spec-kitty-internal exceptions (planning-artifact prefixes such as
``"chore: planning artifacts for "``) were removed as part of #1348 (FR-013):
they constituted a silent bypass. New protected-branch flows require a
capability, not a message convention.

    This helper structurally enforces that the commit lands on the declared
    branch. The destination-ref-aware HEAD assertion runs **before** any
    staging or commit, so a mismatched HEAD aborts cleanly without touching
    the index.

    Validation order (every step short-circuits the rest):

    1. ``destination_ref`` shape: a fully-qualified ``refs/heads/...`` raises
       :class:`SafeCommitDestinationRefShape`.
    2. ``paths`` non-empty: empty raises :class:`SafeCommitEmptyChangeset`.
    3. ``worktree_root`` is a worktree of ``repo_root``: not a worktree raises
       :class:`SafeCommitNotAWorktree`.
    4. Worktree HEAD matches ``destination_ref`` (short form on both sides);
       mismatch raises :class:`SafeCommitHeadMismatch`.
    5. ``destination_ref`` exists in the repo (``git rev-parse --verify``);
       missing raises :class:`SafeCommitDestinationNotFound`.
    6. ``destination_ref`` is not protected unless ``capability`` authorizes a
       protected-branch flow (decided by ``commit_guard.evaluate``); an
       unauthorized protected destination raises :class:`ProtectedBranchRefused`.
    7. Stage ``paths`` via ``git -C <worktree_root> add -- <paths>``.
    8. Staging-area backstop: assert only the requested paths are staged.
    9. Commit and return the new SHA in :class:`CommitResult`.

    All parameters are keyword-only. Exactly one of ``target`` (preferred) or
    ``destination_ref`` (a destination-string compat shim retained for callers
    not yet converted to ``CommitTarget``) identifies the destination; passing
    neither or both is a programming error.

    Protection decision (ADR Step 7 / IC-02 / FR-008): step 6 below delegates
    the "is this destination allowed?" decision SOLELY to
    ``core.commit_guard.evaluate`` (C-GUARD-1). The legacy privilege channels
    (the message-prefix allowlist, the two ``allow_*`` bools, the op-record
    file-content exception, and the ``SPEC_KITTY_TEST_MODE`` env hatch) are
    deleted. ``capability`` is now the ONLY authorization — asserted at the
    call site and NEVER derived from message text, file content, or
    environment (C-GUARD-2). The single retained operator escape hatch,
    ``SPEC_KITTY_ALLOW_PROTECTED_BRANCH_COMMITS``, is consumed by the
    protected-branch pre-checks and by this function's ``ProtectionState``
    input computation (step 6); ``evaluate`` itself never reads the
    environment.

    Args:
        repo_root: Path to the primary git repository.
        worktree_root: Path to the worktree the commit lands in. May equal
            ``repo_root`` when the primary checkout is the worktree.
        destination_ref: Short branch name (e.g. ``"kitty/mission-foo-01ABCDEF"``).
            Must NOT be fully-qualified. Compat shim — pass ``target`` in new code.
        target: The single resolved :class:`CommitTarget`
            (``mission_runtime.context``) the commit lands on. Preferred over
            ``destination_ref``; its ``ref`` is the destination authority.
        message: The commit message.
        paths: Tuple of file paths to commit. Absolute paths are resolved
            relative to ``worktree_root`` when possible.
        capability: Asserted-at-the-surface authorization passed to
            ``commit_guard.evaluate``. Defaults to ``GuardCapability.STANDARD``.

    Returns:
        :class:`CommitResult` carrying the new commit SHA, the declared
        ``destination_ref``, and the ``worktree_root`` it landed in.

    Raises:
        SafeCommitDestinationRefShape: ``destination_ref`` starts with ``refs/heads/``.
        SafeCommitEmptyChangeset: ``paths`` is empty.
        SafeCommitNotAWorktree: ``worktree_root`` is not a git worktree of ``repo_root``.
        SafeCommitHeadMismatch: worktree HEAD does not match ``destination_ref``.
        SafeCommitDestinationNotFound: ``destination_ref`` does not exist in the repo.
        ProtectedBranchRefused: ``destination_ref`` is protected and ``capability``
            authorizes no protected-branch flow.
        SafeCommitBackstopError: the staging area contains paths outside
            ``paths`` at commit time (data-loss prevention).
        SafeCommitRecoveryFailed: caller staging could not be restored, or
