"""Branch ref advance with checked-out-worktree resync (#1826).

The merge pipeline advances ``refs/heads/<branch>`` via ``git update-ref``
from detached temporary worktrees. ``update-ref`` is plumbing: it bypasses
git's checked-out-branch protection and updates nothing in any worktree that
has the branch checked out. That worktree is left with an index/working tree
*behind its own HEAD* — the next safe-commit through it sees phantom staged
deletions, and a plain ``git commit`` from its stale index would silently
delete the advanced commits' files from the branch (#1826).

:func:`advance_branch_ref` is the single sanctioned way for the merge
pipeline to advance a branch ref. **Invariant: no worktree may be left
checked out behind a ref this function advanced.** An architectural ratchet
(``tests/architectural/test_merge_pipeline_ratchets.py``) enforces that no
raw ``update-ref`` subprocess invocation exists in ``src/specify_cli``
outside this module (AC-B3).

Locking: the three merge-pipeline call sites (``lanes/merge.py`` Stage-1
lane→mission advances and ``cli/commands/merge.py`` mission-number baking)
all run inside the global merge lock
(``acquire_merge_lock("__global_merge__", ...)``), which serializes every
merge operation. This helper therefore acquires NO lock of its own — adding
one would introduce a second lock ordering. Callers outside the merge
pipeline must hold an equivalent serialization guarantee.
