"""Skill allowlist — consumer-facing vs internal-only skills.

Only skills in ``CONSUMER_SKILLS`` are written to agent shim directories
during ``generate_all_shims()``.  Skills in ``INTERNAL_SKILLS`` are
reserved for operator/developer use and must never appear in generated
command directories.

Consumer skills are further sub-classified as either *prompt-driven* or
*CLI-driven*:

- **Prompt-driven** commands (``PROMPT_DRIVEN_COMMANDS``) are handled
  entirely by their full prompt template files.  No thin shim files are
  generated for them.
- **CLI-driven** commands (``CLI_DRIVEN_COMMANDS``) are dispatched through
  ``spec-kitty agent shim <command>`` and receive thin 3-line shim files.

The two sets are disjoint and their union equals ``CONSUMER_SKILLS``.
