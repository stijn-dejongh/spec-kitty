"""Fail-loud uninitialized-repo guard (FR-032, WP07/T039).

The ``specify``/``plan``/``tasks`` Typer commands must never silently
fall back to a parent or sibling initialized repository when the cwd
is not itself a Spec Kitty project. :func:`assert_initialized` is the
single entry point that enforces that invariant: it resolves the
canonical mission repo root via :mod:`specify_cli.workspace.root_resolver`
and raises :class:`SpecKittyNotInitialized` if required project markers
are missing.

Callers should invoke this at the very top of their command handler,
*before* any side-effecting work, so a wrong cwd never produces a
file-system write to an unrelated repo.

    Resolution rules:

    * When ``root`` is ``None`` (the typical command-handler path), the
      canonical root is resolved from :func:`Path.cwd` using
      :func:`resolve_canonical_root` so that worktree cwds map to their
      main checkout (FR-013).
    * When ``root`` is supplied (test-friendly path), it is used as-is
      and not redirected to a parent or sibling project.

    A repo is considered initialized when ``<root>/.kittify/config.yaml``
    exists. Commands that operate on existing mission artifacts should
    leave ``require_specs=True`` so ``<root>/kitty-specs/`` is also
    required. ``specify`` passes ``require_specs=False`` because mission
    creation is the code path that lazily creates ``kitty-specs/``.

    Args:
        root: Optional explicit repo root. When omitted the cwd is used.
        require_specs: Require an existing ``kitty-specs/`` directory.

    Returns:
        The validated repo root path.
