"""Decision Point event emission helpers.

Appends ``DecisionPointOpened(interview)`` and ``DecisionPointResolved(interview)``
events to ``kitty-specs/<mission_slug>/status.events.jsonl`` using the
public ``spec_kitty_events.decisionpoint`` payload models (4.0.0 contract).

Event envelope format (one JSON line, sorted keys):
    event_id, at, event_type, payload

The payload is validated by the Pydantic model before serialization.

After the local JSONL append succeeds, both events are also offered on the
same best-effort ``event.publish`` fan-out path already used by
``WPStatusChanged``/``MissionCreated`` (``status.fire_lifecycle_saas_fanout``
→ ``specify_cli.status.zeitgeist_bridge``). Fan-out is fire-and-forget: a
relay outage, missing credential, or codec rejection is logged and dropped,
never raised, and can never roll back or affect the local write that already
happened above it.

Defaults applied when the IndexEntry doesn't supply a value:
    - ``phase``:        ``entry.origin_flow.value.upper()``   (e.g. "CHARTER")
    - ``run_id``:       ``decision_id``                       (no run context in V1)
    - ``actor_type``:   ``"human"``
    - ``mission_type``: ``"software-dev"``
    - ``step_id`` (wire): ``entry.step_id`` if set, else ``entry.slot_key``
      (wire field name is always ``step_id`` for 4.0.0 compat)

    through ``placement_seam(...).write_dir(STATUS_STATE)`` instead of
    ``read_dir`` (write-side-seam-matrix-tracer-01KYP3MH WP02's Move A). A
    decision event appended here is a COORD-partition RECORD, not a read --
    ``read_dir`` degrades a genuinely ``EMPTY`` coordination surface to the
    repository-root checkout (C-002's read-side leniency), which is exactly
    the #5519 fork: the first ``DecisionPointOpened`` would land in the root
    checkout instead of materializing/seeding the coordination Mission dir,
    so a later writer that DOES resolve the coordination surface (e.g. the
    tracer append, which already runs post-materialization) restarts the
    Lamport-proxy clock against an orphaned second log. ``write_dir``
    materializes, seeds, restores, or refuses loudly as the coordination
    state requires -- it is the one write-location accessor every decision
    event writer shares with ``decisions/service.py`` (both resolve
    ``STATUS_STATE``, so reads and writes still agree on where the
    coord-owned decision/status log lives under every topology).

    This helper is the WRITE path only. A caller that only needs to READ
    (list/verify/dry-run) must call ``read_dir`` directly instead -- never
    through this function, which may materialize/seed/restore as a side
    effect (``test_decision_fresh_coord_5113.py``'s list/verify/dry-run

    Family 8 of the writer census (mission ``fsm-write-path-integrity-01M1TZV6``
    WP07, ``design-notes/WP01-lock-rules.md`` addendum): the row lands through
    ``append_raw_rows_atomic`` (write-ahead temp file + ``os.replace``, PII
    stripped via ``sanitize_event_for_log`` inside the primitive) while the
    mission status lock (L1) keyed on the mission directory name is held, so a

    the count is this row's line number, not a later writer's.

    * No ``nullcontext()`` degrade (conscious per-site choice):
      ``resolve_status_lock_root`` never raises and the lock itself degrades to
      a deterministic per-tree file, so there is no case in which skipping
      the lock is safer.
    * Lock timeout: the lock's default (unbounded). Decision emission is
      reached only from the planning interviews, the ``decision`` CLI, the
      widen flows and the orchestrator API -- none of which holds the
      verdict-save queue (rule a) or the merge sentinel (rule b), so neither
      bounded-take rule applies; a finite default is the #3893 follow-up.
