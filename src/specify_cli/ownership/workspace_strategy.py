"""Workspace strategy for planning-artifact work packages.

Provides :func:`create_planning_workspace`, which returns the path that a
planning-artifact WP should use as its working directory.

Planning-artifact WPs produce documentation/specification changes only (no
source-code changes).  They do not need an isolated git worktree because:

* They work directly in the main repository root.
* All planning files (kitty-specs/) are visible there by definition.
* Sparse checkout is NOT used anywhere in spec-kitty (removed in WP04).

The function returns ``repo_root`` so callers receive a consistent ``Path``
whether the WP is ``code_change`` (worktree) or ``planning_artifact`` (repo root).
