Mission #2057 (decompose ``cli/commands/merge.py``) — IC-03 / WP03.

Branch/tree/porcelain git primitives moved byte-for-byte out of the command
shim. Includes the PUBLIC :func:`path_is_under_worktrees` predicate consumed by
``doctor.py`` and ``agent/mission.py``; the shim re-exports it so those importers
