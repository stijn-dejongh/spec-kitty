"""Dry-run forecast (preview + payload build) for the merge seam.

Mission #2057 (decompose ``cli/commands/merge.py``) — IC-06 / WP06.

The ``merge --dry-run`` preview was extracted byte-for-byte out of the ``merge``
command body: lanes-manifest load, the review-artifact consistency gate preview
(emits ``REJECTED_REVIEW_ARTIFACT_CONFLICT`` in both human and JSON output), the
``would_assign_mission_number`` scan, and the JSON/human payload build. The
dry-run JSON key set is frozen by contracts/cli-surface-contract.md (FR-001,
FR-004) and re-asserted by the golden CLI test. One-way import: this module
never imports the command shim.
