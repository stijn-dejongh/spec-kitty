"""Done/approved bookkeeping for the merge seam.

Mission #2057 (decompose ``cli/commands/merge.py``) — IC-08 / WP08.

Done/approved transition emission, the canonical / target-branch done asserts,
the resume reconcile, and the per-WP recording loop moved out of the command
shim. ``_mark_wp_merged_done`` (CC22) and ``_assert_merged_wps_done_on_target``
(CC16) were decomposed into focused helpers (each <= 15 CC, FR-005) preserving
the PLANNED-fallback / force-done / dedup branching exactly. ``_mark_wp_merged_done``
is consumed by ``orchestrator_api/commands.py`` and is re-exported from the shim
(FR-006). One-way import: this module never imports the command shim.
