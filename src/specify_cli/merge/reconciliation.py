"""Post-merge reconciliation: emit done events from actual git ancestry.

Implements T041: after merging WP branches into the target branch, verify
which WP branches are reachable (``git branch --merged``) in the merge
workspace and emit ``done`` status events for those that have not yet been
marked done.

This is the authoritative, git-backed source of truth for "was this WP
actually integrated?" — it does NOT rely on in-memory tracking from the
merge loop.
