"""Post-merge review baseline (``baseline_merge_commit``) record/verify cluster.

This module owns the mission-state-surface concern of the ``baseline_merge_commit``
``meta.json`` field: it is written here at merge time and read by
``spec-kitty review --mode post-merge``. Extracted verbatim from
``cli/commands/merge.py`` as part of the merge.py god-module decomposition
(epic #2026); behavior is byte-identical to the original definitions.

``merge/`` deliberately does NOT import ``cli.commands.merge``, so relocating
this cluster here introduces no import cycle.

    Mirrors :func:`_assert_merged_wps_reached_done`: it reads the target

    ``git show <target>:<path>`` and asserts ``baseline_merge_commit`` is both

    ``MISSION_REVIEW_MODE_MISMATCH``: it proves the baseline is durable in git
    history (not just in the working tree) before any worktree removal or
    branch cleanup runs.

    *feature_dir* (the idempotent value written by
    :func:`record_baseline_merge_commit`) and only falls back to
    *expected_baseline* when that is unavailable. This is deliberate:
    ``target_baseline_sha`` is re-derived from the live target HEAD on every
    invocation, so on ``spec-kitty merge --resume`` — after a prior run already
    landed the mission/bookkeeping commits — the live HEAD has advanced past the
    original baseline. Comparing the committed value against a re-derived HEAD
    would spuriously fail an otherwise-correct resume; comparing it against the
    recorded value does not.
