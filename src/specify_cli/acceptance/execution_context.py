"""The value a gate is *handed* — surface, ref, phase — and cannot derive.

This module introduces the :class:`GateExecutionContext` value object (the
``(surface, ref, phase)`` bundle a gate judges from), the ordered
:class:`LifecyclePhase` enum, and the distinguishable *cannot-evaluate* outcome.
Together they convert #1834 from a per-site fix into a **property of every gate**:
a gate judges the surface it is handed, names that surface on its verdict, and
refuses — rather than passing or failing — when the surface cannot hold the fact.

Design (data-model.md ``GateExecutionContext`` GEC-1..GEC-5, ``LifecyclePhase``
PH-1; contract ``gate-execution-context.md`` C1..C7):

* **GEC-1 — Not derivable.** A gate *receives* a :class:`GateExecutionContext`; it
  may not construct one from ``repo_root`` / ``os.getcwd()`` / a bare dir. The ONE
  construction door is :func:`build_gate_execution_context`, which resolves the
  surface through the WP02 seam (:func:`mission_runtime.resolve_artifact_surface`)
  rather than any ambient location.
* **GEC-2 / C5 — Ref agreement.** :meth:`GateExecutionContext.assert_at_ref`
  verifies the surface is actually at :attr:`GateExecutionContext.ref` before a
  gate judges it, and raises :class:`GateSurfaceRefMismatch` otherwise (mirroring
  the ``safe_commit`` HEAD-vs-destination assert). It is an explicit, injectable
  gate step — construction stays pure, so a gate that runs against a non-checkout
  surface is never forced through a HEAD read it does not need.
* **GEC-3 / C3 — Total resolution.** The four ``CoordState`` answers are supplied by
  the consumed WP02 resolver: ``DELETED`` raises ``CoordinationBranchDeleted``;
  ``EMPTY`` / ``UNMATERIALIZED`` resolve primary and **stamp** ``PRIMARY``;
  ``MATERIALIZED`` resolves coord. This module never re-derives that classifier.
* **GEC-5 / C2 — A stamp is not permission.** :meth:`GateExecutionContext.surface_cannot_hold`
  refuses (cannot-evaluate) when a kind whose declared home is ``COORD`` is judged
  against a surface stamped ``PRIMARY`` — the create-window substitution — so the
  #2885 "empty surface → pass by default" failure is reported honestly.
* **PH-1 — Phase floor.** :meth:`GateExecutionContext.not_applicable_below` returns
  the cannot-evaluate outcome (never a pass/fail) when the context's phase is below
  the gate's declared minimum.

Topology neutrality (GEC-4 / C-004 / C7): no field, name, or branch of
:class:`GateExecutionContext` is conditioned on coordination topology, and nothing
here reads the ``flattened`` flag. :func:`declared_home_surface` consults the ONE
canonical partition + :func:`mission_runtime.routes_through_coordination` predicate
over the *stored* topology — the same authority the resolver itself uses — to answer
"where does this kind authoritatively live", which is a per-kind home fact, not a
coord-topology branch.
