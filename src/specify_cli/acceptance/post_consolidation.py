"""Post-consolidation verification of ``deferred_to_consolidation`` invariants.

The acceptance gate (``gates_core.py``, the matrix's single pre-consolidation
reader) cannot judge an invariant whose subject only comes into existence once a
mission's lane branches are integrated: pre-consolidation those changes live on
lane branches, so the tree being checked cannot contain them. Such an invariant is
recorded ``deferred_to_consolidation`` (FR-003 / C4) rather than reported as a
false ``still_present``.

This module is the seam that honours that deferral **after** consolidation
(FR-004 / C6). It reads the consolidated mission tree and the acceptance matrix,
re-judges every ``deferred_to_consolidation`` invariant against that consolidated
tree, and writes the outcome back with ``verified_surface_kind = CONSOLIDATED`` and
the consolidation commit as ``verified_ref``. A deferred invariant that proves
``still_present`` fails **this op** and names the invariant (FR-005 / C7).

Design constraints (deliberate, load-bearing — see contract C7 and WP06):

* **Dispatched as a governed Op, not a merge call-in.** This runs as an ordinary
  governed Op through the canonical surface (``spec-kitty dispatch``, closed with
  ``profile-invocation complete``). It is a plain library function that returns a
  :class:`PostConsolidationResult`; the dispatched Op maps ``result.passed`` onto
  its ``done`` / ``failed`` outcome. There is **no new CLI verb** and **no call-in
  from** ``merge/executor.py``.
* **Zero ``merge/`` coupling.** Nothing here imports ``specify_cli.merge`` or the
  consolidation rollback machinery. The judging logic is reused wholesale from the
  matrix's own public :func:`enforce_negative_invariants`, so this module stays
  file-disjoint from the consolidation transaction (WP06 review guidance).
* **Runs AFTER consolidation; never rolls it back.** The op fails the *verification*
  when an invariant is violated — the consolidation itself has already completed
  cleanly and is left untouched (C7). No abort path is added inside the
  consolidation transaction, and no rollback is attempted. The blast radius is the
  mission/PR branch, not ``origin/main``: a violation blocks the pull request,
  which is where it should block.

Enforcement that a mission does not *reach done* with a dangling deferral is the
external CI check (FR-016 / WP18), not a guardrail in this module.
