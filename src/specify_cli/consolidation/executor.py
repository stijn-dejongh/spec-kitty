"""Lane-based merge executor for the merge seam.

Mission #2057 (decompose ``cli/commands/merge.py``) — IC-10 / WP10 (HIGH-RISK).

Relocates ``_run_lane_based_consolidation`` (the global-lock wrapper) and the CC-102
``_run_lane_based_consolidation_locked`` driver out of the command shim, decomposing the
driver into phase helpers (each <= 15 CC) that thread shared mutable state via
the :class:`_MergeRunState` dataclass — never closures (INV-3). The decomposition
preserves, byte-for-byte:

* INV-5 — the #1827 ordering: baseline RECORD (post-target-merge, pre-
  bookkeeping-commit, in ``_phase_capture_and_baseline``) → bookkeeping
  ``safe_commit`` → baseline ASSERT (post-commit) — the commit and the assert
  run in ``_phase_commit_and_assert`` in exactly that order.
* INV-6 — the ``restore_generated_artifact_snapshots(...)``-then-reraise rollback
  sites, each with identical exception-class scoping.

Lazy imports inside the phases stay lazy (C-007). One-way import: this module
never imports the command shim.

    (never routed through the mode-softened evidence gate; C-003, no new error

    event-log reader (C-002).

    ``run.excluded_canceled_wp_ids`` (WPs resolved ONCE at lock entry via

    A WP declared in ``run.all_wp_ids`` but ABSENT from the reduced snapshot
    (no status event on the read surface at all) is treated as NOT ready and
    folded into ``missing`` — never silently dropped. A gate this is meant to

    missing snapshot entry is strictly less evidence of readiness than an
    ``in_progress`` one, so it must refuse, not pass. That absent-WP

    #5100 WP04 cycle-2 fix (review issue 2): ONLY an EXPLICIT frontmatter

    reliable "code" signal here. A WP with no ``execution_mode`` in its
    frontmatter normalizes via :func:`~specify_cli.ownership.inference.infer_execution_mode`,
    which DEFAULTS to ``code_change`` when the body carries neither a
    planning nor a code signal (``mode_source == "inferred_legacy"``) -- the

    #5100 WP04 cycle-3 fix (review issue 1): the frontmatter-only filter
    above over-corrected -- it also drops a REAL legacy lanes/coord

       independence for the baseline invariant).
    2. ``run.assigned_mission_number`` -- the number THIS run's
       mission-branch bake just freshly computed. Only reached when the
       target did NOT already have one, so it can never disagree with (1).
    3. The mission branch's own committed value, when this run's bake
       short-circuited (resume / idempotency hit / already-baked no-op) but
       a PRIOR run already wrote it there and the target-tree write never
       landed (e.g. the process crashed between the mission-branch write and

    runtime at the merge bake stage, reusing :func:`cutover_mission` as the SOLE
    ``status_phase`` writer (no forked writer — the two-target form EXTENDS the
    spine).

    **Timing (T043 — a documented DEVIATION from the classic pre-target
    ``_bake_mission_number`` hook; see ``tracers/design-decisions.md`` IC-08 for
    the full rationale):** wired here, immediately AFTER the target merge
    (``_phase_mission_to_target`` already advanced the target ref) and AFTER
    :func:`_project_status_bookkeeping_to_target` just above — NOT at the
    pre-target bake hook (``ordering._bake_mission_number_into_mission_branch``,
    ``executor.py`` bake phase). A detached mission-branch worktree (the
    mission-number bake's own mechanism) cannot host the flip: ``_flip_phase``
    resolves its write target via ``canonicalize_feature_dir``, which follows
    ANY real worktree's ``.git`` pointer back to the canonical main-repo root
    (``resolve_canonical_root`` — confirmed by inspection) and — because
    planning artifacts (``meta.json``) already live on the target branch from
    mission-creation time — would silently redirect the flip back onto
    ``main_repo``'s STALE pre-merge ``meta.json`` instead of the intended
    mission-branch tip. Running post-target on ``run.target_feature_dir`` (the
    real, just-merged, already-refreshed PRIMARY checkout) sidesteps that hazard
    entirely and reuses the SAME resume/heal machinery already governing the
    bookkeeping commit (below) rather than inventing a parallel one.

    **Two-partition split (T044 / IC-08 risk 2):** ``run.target_feature_dir``
    (PRIMARY — real, up-to-date ``tasks/`` post-merge) is the read+flip leg;
    ``run.canonical_events_path.parent`` (the topology-aware STATUS/COORD leg,
    already resolved at merge entry via ``resolve_status_surface`` — the SAME
    port-routed authority ``_project_status_bookkeeping_to_target`` above just
    read from) is the seed+verify leg. They collapse to the same directory
    under flat/single-branch topology (T047's degenerate case). Because this runs
    AFTER the projection call above, a seed appended to the COORD leg is then
    re-projected onto the PRIMARY copy (:func:`_project_birth_cutover_seed_to_target`,
    #4787): PRIMARY is the post-merge status authority and the coord triple is
    torn down, so a COORD-only seed would leave the flipped mission's canonical
    log without its deterministic seed rows.

    **Resume-heal (T045 / IC-08 risk 3):** no new marker/transaction is
    introduced. ``cutover_mission`` is idempotent by construction (the seed
    phase skips already-seeded deterministic ids; the flip short-circuits once
    ``status_phase`` is snapshot-authority), so a crash between the COORD seed
    write and the PRIMARY flip heals by mere re-invocation on ``merge
    --resume`` — this SAME phase reruns and completes whichever leg is still
    open, with zero duplicate writes (NFR-002).

    Best-effort / non-fatal: a cutover failure must not abort an otherwise
    successful merge (the runtime-state gap remains repairable via the
    standing ``migrate backfill-runtime-state`` command) — logged, never
    raised, and skipped entirely for a mission with no code WPs to
    reconcile.

    #5100 T020 / plan fold B3: keyed on :func:`_run_has_code_wps` (a WP-kind
    question), never ``run.planning_artifact_only`` (lane-based) -- a
    single_branch mission's ONE repo-root lane reads as lane-based
    "planning-only" even when it holds real CODE WPs, which would wrongly
    skip their runtime-state reconciliation.

    review F1/F2 — architect / debbie / paula converged on the same block).

    Closes three faults in the original inline commit:

    1. **Right partition through the seam (F1, #2884).** ``status.events.jsonl``
       is a ``STATUS_STATE`` = COORD-partition artifact. It routes through
       :func:`commit_coord_seed_bookkeeping`, which selects
       ``MissionArtifactKind.STATUS_STATE`` so the placement port resolves the
       COORD ref (the coordination branch under coordination topology) — the ref
       the coord worktree's HEAD is already on, so ``safe_commit``'s
       HEAD-must-match-destination guard is satisfied (no
       ``SafeCommitHeadMismatch``). ``run.pre_target_coord_ref`` is passed only as
       the degrade-path fallback (used solely if placement resolution fails).
       This is ONE kind-parameterized bookkeeping seam, not a duplicated
       guard-capability call site: PR #2920's earlier direct-``safe_commit``
       workaround wrongly assumed the seam could only serve the PRIMARY partition
       (it merely hardcoded ``PRIMARY_METADATA``).

    2. **Resume-heal asymmetry (F2).** The old guard ``result.seeded_count > 0``
       is a PER-RUN delta that is 0 on ``merge --resume`` — so an interrupted
       merge that seeded events to disk but died before this commit skipped it
       forever on resume, stranding them uncommitted while the sticky ``flipped``
       leg healed. We gate on the coord worktree's ACTUAL dirty state
       (``_paths_have_status_changes``) so resume completes whichever leg is open.

    3. **Fatal on failure.** The old call sat outside the best-effort ``try`` and
       could abort an otherwise-successful merge. This helper never raises —
       birth-cutover is best-effort (repairable via ``migrate
       backfill-runtime-state``).

    """issue #3086: clear the coordination marker once the coord branch is gone.

    ``spec-kitty consolidate --delete-branch`` (the default) deletes a Mission's
    coordination branch (``kitty/mission-<slug>``) from git but, before this fix,
    left the paired ``coordination_branch`` key in
    ``kitty-specs/<slug>/meta.json``. Every later command routing through
    ``resolve_status_surface_with_anchor`` then hit ``CoordState.DELETED`` and
    raised ``CoordinationBranchDeleted`` — the deliberate #1848 data-loss
    hard-fail — a 100% crash on merged coord missions.

    This mirrors the canonical flatten already performed by
    ``spec-kitty mission close --discard`` and ``doctor coordination --fix``:
    all three converge on the single
    :func:`~specify_cli.mission_metadata.flatten_coordination_metadata`
    primitive (#3219 / FR-015 / D-PLAN-17), rather than each call site
    inventing its own copy of the pop-``coordination_branch`` / pop-``topology``
    / set-``flattened`` mutation set.

    **Known residual (T054, verdict-seam-write-unification-01KZ9Q35 WP10):**
    this flatten (and its bookkeeping commit) runs in
    ``_phase_cleanup_worktrees_and_branches``, which executes AFTER
    ``_phase_push``. On a ``spec-kitty consolidate --push``, the flatten bookkeeping
    commit therefore lands LOCAL-ONLY -- it is never pushed to origin, so
    origin/target keeps the stale ``coordination_branch`` key even though the
    local target branch is correctly flattened. Verified as a real, pre-existing
    ordering gap (not introduced or regressed by WP10's convergence); fixing it
    would mean either re-ordering the two phases or pushing a second time after
    cleanup, both out of WP10's scope (a lane-owned convergence WP, not a merge
    phase-ordering change) -- tracked as a follow-up rather than silently
    expanded into here.

    Placement & ordering. This lives in the ``delete_branch`` gate, co-located
    with the branch deletion, so the marker is cleared **iff** the branch it
    names is deleted — the two mutations stay atomic. It is deliberately NOT
    folded into the earlier, unconditional ``_phase_commit_and_assert``: doing so
    would (a) require duplicating this gate's ``delete_branch`` guard into a phase
    that must stay unconditional, and (b) clear the marker *before* the branch is
    deleted, so a failed deletion would strand the inverse inconsistency (a
    cleared marker with a still-live branch). It still runs after the lane->target
    merge-driver reconciliation (which treats ``coordination_branch`` as a
    *theirs-authoritative* planning key, ``consolidation/drivers.py``), so the clear
    is the last writer regardless.

    The edit is persisted through the same protected-flow bookkeeping-commit seam
    the merge uses for its other meta.json mutations. A commit failure here is
    logged and swallowed (fail-open), never raised: this runs in the post-push
    cleanup phase, the on-disk flatten has already cleared ``coordination_branch``
    (so #3086 stays fixed), and aborting an otherwise-complete merge — or
    restoring the pre-flatten snapshot, which would re-strand the marker — is
    worse than a locally-dirty meta.json (recoverable via
    ``spec-kitty doctor coordination --fix``).

    A non-coord Mission (``SINGLE_BRANCH`` / ``LANES``) or an already-flattened
    one carries no ``coordination_branch`` key, so this is an idempotent no-op
    that leaves ``topology`` / ``flattened`` untouched.

    before ``_phase_merge_lanes`` (which git-merges lanes into the mission

    done-event on the coord branch). This is the only placement where a

    ``--resume`` merge route through the same outer function, ``--resume``
    honors this preflight identically (US1 AC4) with no separate wiring.

    Checks, in order:

    1. The primary checkout is on ``target_branch`` and clean
       (``MERGE_UNSAFE_PRIMARY_OFF_TARGET`` / ``MERGE_UNSAFE_PRIMARY_DIRTY`` —
       FR-001/FR-002/US1 AC1-2).

       ``remove_worktree`` is False (worktree retention in effect), in which
       case a dirty lane worktree is the existing retention path's concern
       (kept, never force-removed) rather than a preflight refusal (US2 AC2).
       This mirrors exactly the gate ``_phase_cleanup_worktrees_and_branches``
       already applies to its own removal loop.
    3. The coordination worktree, when the mission is coord-topology AND the
       coupled coord teardown is actually going to run (``teardown_coordination``
       — ``delete_branch AND remove_worktree``, #3131 INV-2), is clean
       (FR-004/US2 AC4). Gating on ``teardown_coordination`` rather than
       ``remove_worktree`` alone matches ``_cleanup_mission_branch_and_coordination``'s
       real gate for a coord mission, so a partial-retention merge that will
       never touch the coord triple is never refused for a dirty coord
       worktree it was never going to disturb (NFR-002 no-regression).

    ``reset --hard`` that refreshes the checkout never ran, so the already-integrated
    lane's files read as local changes. The generic "commit/stash/revert" remedy is
    DANGEROUS there (recording them reverts the merge). Route a
    ``MERGE_UNSAFE_PRIMARY_DIRTY`` refusal through
    :func:`~specify_cli.consolidation.preflight.classify_resume_dirty_remedy` so a
    behind-own-HEAD (or interrupted-``reset``) state gets the safe reset-to-HEAD
    remedy instead. Advisory only — the refusal still aborts fail-closed BEFORE any
    mutation (NFR-001); this only changes the printed guidance.

    #4933: on a FRESH consolidation the mission branch is created off the target
    and never advances until the lanes merge, so it is trivially "already an
    ancestor of HEAD" — the lane-ancestry-only ``BEHIND_OWN_HEAD`` classification
    misfires on every dirty refusal, not just a genuinely interrupted terminus.
    Printing the reset-to-HEAD guidance there tells the operator to run
    ``git reset --hard HEAD``, which destroys the very user edit (e.g. a dirty
    ``src/app/meta.json``) the refusal protects. The upgraded guidance is now gated on
    :func:`~specify_cli.consolidation.preflight.is_pure_behind_head_lag`, the
    content proof #4997 already uses for the ``--resume`` auto-recovery path
    (:func:`_recover_behind_head_primary_on_resume`): it needs a persisted
    ``ConsolidationState.pre_mutation_target_sha`` (``base_sha``) that is a STRICT
    ancestor of HEAD with a byte-identical tree/index and no obstructing untracked
    path. A fresh consolidation has no persisted state (``base_sha=None``), so the
    predicate is fail-closed False and this always falls through to the safe
    commit/stash/revert remedy already present in ``str(exc)``. ``BLOCKED_INDEX_LOCK``
    is unaffected -- it never claims a specific working-tree state to reset into, so
    it carries no #4933 hazard and stays gated on classification alone.
