"""Merge-driver bodies: the single owner of all seven registered drivers (#5119).

Seven custom drivers keep mission bookkeeping semantic under the mission→target
``git merge --squash`` in ``lanes/consolidation.py::_merge_branch_into`` (#4892 dropped
the old ``-X theirs``; ordinary source paths now fail closed on conflict). A
custom driver takes over conflict resolution on the paths it is registered for,
so target-newer canonical state is reconciled rather than clobbered or
hard-conflicting (#2709 / FR-003 / FR-004 / FR-008):

- ``merge-driver-event-log``         — ``status.events.jsonl`` union (append-only log).
- ``merge-driver-meta``              — ``meta.json`` field merge: acceptance/VCS keys
  target-authoritative (the accepted-newer ``ours`` side), ``acceptance_history``
  unioned, all other (planning) keys mission-authoritative (``theirs``; preserves
  the #1732 planning-artifact authority — mission keys win).
- ``merge-driver-traces``            — ``traces/*.md`` markdown union: order-preserving
  line-level dedup so both sides' sections survive without duplication.
- ``merge-driver-acceptance-matrix`` — ``acceptance-matrix.json`` row-aware,
  base-aware (3-way) merge over ``criteria``/``negative_invariants``, keyed by
  ``criterion_id``/``invariant_id`` (FR-008 / see ``contracts/merge-driver-
  algorithm.md``).
- ``merge-driver-issue-matrix``      — ``issue-matrix.json`` row-aware,
  base-aware (3-way) merge over ``rows``, keyed by canonicalized ``issue_ref``.
- ``merge-driver-review-cycle``      — ``tasks/<wp>/review-cycle-*.md``
  best-effort, non-aborting reconciliation of a two-verdict collision
  (originally a refuse-fail-closed driver, review-cycle-verdict-seam-rebuild-
  01KZ2W7W WP18/T077; DOWNGRADED by verdict-seam-write-unification-01KZ9Q35
  WP09/FR-014/D-PLAN-6 now that the ``.md`` is non-authoritative, unread
  prose — see :func:`run_review_cycle_driver`'s own docstring for the full
  history and why a divergent collision no longer aborts the squash).
- ``merge-driver-decision-index``     — ``decisions/index.json`` union keyed
  by ``decision_id``, terminal-beats-open fold precedence (FR-009b / D13 /
  #5023 — see :func:`run_decision_index_driver`).

Git invokes a driver with ``%O %A %B`` = base / ours / theirs and expects the
merged result written to the ``ours`` (``%A``) path with exit 0. Under the squash
integration ``ours`` is the target checkout (e.g. ``main``) and ``theirs`` is the
mission branch.

**#2970 path-injection hardening (S2083).** Every driver's ``%O``/``%A``/``%B``
argv is externally-supplied (git-computed, but syntactically untrusted input to
this process). Per gitattributes(5) and confirmed empirically, git ALWAYS
materializes the three placeholders as sibling temp files in ONE directory (the
top of the working tree) for a real merge; every driver-unit test in this
codebase constructs them as siblings under one ``tmp_path`` for the same reason.
:func:`_resolve_merge_driver_paths` enforces exactly that invariant — the three
resolved paths must share a parent directory — before any read/write. An
absolute path or a ``..`` escape routing one placeholder outside that shared
directory (the concrete shape of the 5 S2083 BLOCKER findings) is refused
red-first, without narrowing any reconciliation rule below.

**Placement (#5119 / FR-002).** This module owns every driver's file-level
body AND its serialization — the exact reconcile-then-write bytes each driver
produces. Two callers execute the SAME body: the git-invoked subprocess shell
(``cli/commands/merge_driver.py``, a thin adapter translating a body's
:class:`MergeDriverError`/:class:`MergeDriverOutcome` to
``typer.echo``/``typer.Exit``) and the in-process driver replay
(``consolidation/git_probes.py::_resolve_registered_driver_callable``, via
:data:`MERGE_DRIVER_BODIES`). This module's own source must not import
``typer`` or any ``specify_cli.cli`` module other than the reviewed
``specify_cli.cli.console`` ledger entries (:class:`TestMergeCliBoundary`
enforces this as a direct-import scan over ``specify_cli/consolidation/**`` sources —
it does not follow this module's own imports transitively) — a body never
calls ``sys.exit``/raises ``typer.Exit``; it raises :class:`MergeDriverError`
(``str(exc)`` is the exact stderr text) and
returns a :class:`MergeDriverOutcome` (``notice``, when set, is the exact
stdout text) instead. See ``contracts/merge-driver-body.md`` for the binding
contract.

# DOWNGRADED by verdict-seam-write-unification-01KZ9Q35 WP09/FR-014/D-PLAN-6):
# a two-verdict collision is embedded, best-effort, and NEVER aborts the squash
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# T017's discharge (see WP04's ruling and tests/architectural/test_merge_reconciliation_
# class_guard.py::test_review_cycle_tasks_hazard_is_ruled_and_tracked): the
# create-window split (ADR 2026-08-03-1) means a coord mission's review
# cycles land on TWO different physical surfaces during the migration window
# (cycle 1 on PRIMARY at ``tasks/<wp>/``, a later cycle mis-numbered "1" again
# on COORD because ``ReviewCycleArtifact.next_cycle_number`` globs only the
# worktree it is called from) -- so a genuine, DIFFERENT-content collision
# under the SAME ``review-cycle-N.md`` filename is reachable, not
# hypothetical.
#
# THE ORIGINAL DESIGN DECISION (T077, weighed against FR-006 / C-002(b)):
#
#   (a) REFUSE fail-closed -- embed both raw verdict documents, verbatim and
#       clearly demarcated (never interleaved/blended), and exit non-zero so
#       ``git merge --squash`` reports the path as an unresolved
#       conflict (``_merge_branch_into`` then tears down the squash and
#       raises -- the target ref is never advanced).
#
#   (b) RENUMBER -- silently reassign the incoming ("theirs") record the next
#       free cycle number in the reconciled directory and write it out as a
#       SECOND file, leaving ``ours`` untouched.
#
# WP18 implemented (a), not (b), because at the time a ``review-cycle-N.md``
# was the AUTHORITATIVE verdict record -- a reader could not tell a blended or
# silently-renumbered document from a genuine one, so any automatic
# reconciliation risked "inventing" a verdict decision (C-002(b)/FR-006).
#
# THE WP09/FR-014 DOWNGRADE (D-PLAN-6): the review-cycle-verdict-seam-rebuild
# mission's own WP05 (this mission's dependency) demoted the ``.md`` render to
# non-authoritative, unread best-effort prose -- ``status.events.jsonl``'s
# ``review_result`` event slot is now the sole verdict authority (see
# ``kitty-specs/verdict-seam-write-unification-01KZ9Q35/contracts/
# provenance-backfill.md``). With no reader left that trusts this document's
# ``cycle_number``/``verdict`` fields to decide "which record is latest", the
# fabrication risk (a) was refusing to accept no longer applies: two divergent
# best-effort renders colliding under one filename are ordinary prose drift,
# not a decision an automated driver would be wrong to reconcile. Aborting an
# otherwise-clean squash over unread prose is now pure friction with no
# safety benefit, so this driver is DOWNGRADED to non-aborting: it still
# embeds BOTH raw documents verbatim (never blending/interleaving/fabricating
# a merged verdict -- the same "never silently drop a side" discipline this
# module's row-matrix field-conflict markers use), but no longer raises an
# error -- the squash proceeds with the conflict-marked prose as the resolved
# content. Retiring the driver entirely (letting the collision fail closed
# like any other ordinary conflict) was considered and rejected only because
# embedding both sides costs nothing and preserves strictly more information
# than a hard conflict would.
#
# Identical content on both sides is NOT a collision at all -- it is the
# trivial, common case (the same verdict was independently recorded/copied
# onto both partitions) and resolves cleanly with no conflict markers.

    Two distinct verdict documents colliding under the same filename are

    module-level design-decision comment immediately above this function for
    the full reasoning (embed both verbatim, never fabricate a blended

    longer aborts the squash (FR-014/D-PLAN-6): the ``.md`` render is
    non-authoritative, unread prose now that ``status.events.jsonl``'s
    ``review_result`` event slot is the sole verdict authority, so refusing
    the merge over it is no longer justified. The collision notice is
    returned via :attr:`MergeDriverOutcome.notice` for the CLI shell to echo

    Identical content on both sides (byte-for-byte) is the trivial fast path:
