"""Three-way recency for PRIMARY-partition planning artifacts on squash (#3942).

The mission→target squash merge (``lanes/merge.py`` ``_merge_branch_into``) runs
a normal three-way ``git merge --squash <mission_branch>`` (#4892 dropped the old
blanket ``-X theirs``). The six driver-covered ``kitty-specs/**`` bookkeeping
classes reconcile through ``_MERGE_DRIVERS``, and ordinary source conflicts now
fail closed. For PRIMARY-partition planning artifacts (``spec.md`` /
``tasks/WP*.md`` among them) a same-region conflict is instead resolved by this
recency policy: when planning is refined on the *target* after the mission branch
forks, the target-newer content must win rather than being clobbered by the older
mission copy (#3942).

A git merge driver cannot fix this: a driver sees only three blobs (base / ours /
theirs) and has no history access, so it cannot decide *which side is newer*.
Recency is a repository-history question. This module answers it purely (git
reads only, no writes / no side effects) so the executor can capture the target's
pre-squash bytes and restore them after the squash when the target is newer.

Three-way rule (D-A3): a changed PRIMARY-partition planning path is *target-newer*
when the target diverged from ``merge-base(target, source)`` on that path while
the lane copy is base-or-ancestor (the lane did not advance it). When *both*
sides advanced the same path, the tiebreak is the committer-date of the last
commit that touched the path on each side — target wins on a strictly-later date
**or a tie** (the conservative "do not clobber the target" default; never mtime).
