"""Migrate hash-scoped SQLite queues into the append-only event journal (WP10).

This is plan concern **IC-07**: lift the events that are still *currently queued*
in the legacy ``queue.db`` and every scoped ``queues/queue-<digest>.db`` into the
WP03 :class:`~specify_cli.event_journal.EventJournal`, recording per-source
provenance and quarantining divergent-duplicate collisions — without ever
fabricating identity, rewriting an ``event_id``, or touching a source DB.

The unrecoverable-identity reality (contract §5; spec edge case "Hash-only scoped
DB paths"): the queue digest is a **one-way** SHA-256 of ``server|user|team``
(``sync/queue.py::build_queue_scope`` + ``scope_db_path``). The original URL/team
cannot be derived from the filename, so:

* a source whose digest matches the WP01 resolved target's derived queue path is
  attached **best-effort** to that *known* target handle, and
* any unmatched digest (and the legacy ``queue.db``) is attached to an explicit
  **``unknown``** provenance marker — never a guessed URL/team.

Guarantees pinned by ``tests/sync/test_migrate_journal.py``:

* **FR-013 / SC-006** — *all* scoped DBs + legacy ``queue.db`` are discovered and
  every currently-queued payload is preserved across one run; delivered-and-deleted
  history is unrecoverable (only queued payloads survive).
* **NFR-005** — import is idempotent on re-run (journal ``INSERT OR IGNORE`` on
  ``event_id`` + provenance keyed on ``(event_id, source_digest)``); one bad/locked
  source is reported without aborting the others.
* **C-005** — ``event_id`` is carried through verbatim, never rewritten.
* **FR-018 / SC-011** — same ``event_id`` + *divergent* canonical payload writes a
  migration-conflict/audit row, leaves the existing journal payload and the source
  DB untouched, blocks cleanup, and exits non-zero/blocked.

Per **C-001** this module writes only through the WP03 journal public API and its
own migration-audit store (provenance/conflicts are migration metadata that have
no home on a delivery-state ledger row); it never re-implements those tables.
During **import** (:func:`migrate_queues_to_journal`) source DBs are opened
**read-only** so they are structurally untouched.

**Cleanup (#2665) — RETIRED.** Import alone never converges the legacy-row
boundary: the rows stay in the source queues, so ``sync now`` / ``sync
opt-in`` refuse forever. This module used to carry a separate, gated
follow-up (``cleanup_migrated_sources``) that deleted the confirmed-migrated
rows (provenance ∩ journal) from each source once a migration was clean, plus
an explicit conflict-resolution recovery path (``resolve_conflicts_keep_journal``).
Both deleted source rows via ``OfflineQueue(db_path=source_path)`` — pointing
the queue class directly at an arbitrary discovered source file. That
constructor was retired when ``OfflineQueue`` moved onto the per-project store
(``unit``/``authority``) API (see ``sync/queue.py``), which has no notion of an
arbitrary source file path, so neither step has an equivalent against the new
class. Both were already unreachable in practice (``sync migrate``
unconditionally refuses; see ``cli/commands/sync.py::migrate``) and were
removed rather than ported — see the note above ``CleanupResult`` /
``ConflictResolution`` below for the full rationale.

# a legacy per-source ``queue.db`` file via ``OfflineQueue(db_path=source_path)``
# — pointing the queue class directly at an arbitrary discovered source file.

# there is no way to express "delete these ids from this legacy source file"
# against the new class — the two concepts no longer intersect.
#
# This is safe to drop rather than port: ``cleanup_migrated_sources`` and
# ``resolve_conflicts_keep_journal`` (formerly defined here, alongside their
# private helpers ``_delete_migrated_rows``/``_read_row_payload`` and the
# ``CleanupOutcome`` dataclass) had exactly one caller, ``converge_legacy_runtime``
# below, which itself has zero live callers: the CLI's ``sync migrate`` command
# unconditionally refuses (see ``cli/commands/sync.py::migrate``), and
# ``tests/specify_cli/cli/commands/test_sync_opt_in_converge.py`` pins that the
# auto-migration seam never invokes ``converge_legacy_runtime`` either.
# ``converge_legacy_runtime`` itself is kept (see its docstring) purely because
# that test monkeypatches it by name to prove it stays uncalled.

    The single orchestration shared by ``sync migrate`` and the auto-migration:

    1. import queued events into the journal (read-only on sources);
    2. **project stored identity into the journal's identity columns** (#3030 H4).

    Step 2 belongs to convergence, not beside it: a row sitting in the journal with
    ``project_uuid IS NULL`` is *not* converged. ``delivery/selection.py`` makes
    NULL permanently unselectable, so before this step every pre-mission row — and
    every row this very function imports, since ``_build_event`` sets no identity
    columns — was undeliverable forever, including the operator's OWN consenting
    project's history. That is a data-availability defect that reads as "sync is
    broken", and nothing in ``src/`` ran the backfill that recovers it.

    It runs after import so freshly-imported rows are included. Identity is only
    ever RECOVERED from the row's own stored envelope, never invented: a row
    whose payload carries no resolvable uuid stays NULL and stays unselectable,
    so the fail-closed egress boundary is untouched.

    Consent records are deliberately NOT backfilled here. That write is
    machine-global, and because the uuid index outranks the repo default it can
    change a project's effective answer — see ``sync migrate``'s
    ``--backfill-consent-index`` flag, which is opt-in for exactly that reason.
    This function is also reached from ``sync enable``'s auto-convergence, which
    must never rewrite consent as a side effect of enabling one checkout.

    Idempotent: on an already-converged runtime every step is a no-op. Nothing
    is ever lost — import is read-only and the identity backfill considers only
    NULL rows and never overwrites a stored value.

    ``resolve_conflicts`` and ``cleanup`` are retired no-ops kept only for
    signature stability (see the module note above ``CleanupResult`` /
    ``ConflictResolution``): both used to delete rows from a legacy per-source
    ``queue.db`` file via the now-retired ``OfflineQueue(db_path=...)``
    constructor, which has no equivalent against the per-project-store
    ``OfflineQueue``. This function has no live caller (``sync migrate``
    unconditionally refuses; ``tests/specify_cli/cli/commands/test_sync_opt_in_converge.py``
    pins that the auto-migration seam never invokes it either), so the
    parameters are dead weight rather than a live contract — kept anyway so an
    eventual removal of this whole function is a separate, deliberate change.
