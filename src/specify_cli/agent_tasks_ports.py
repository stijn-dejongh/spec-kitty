"""Injected capability ports for the ``agent tasks`` command surface (WP02).

Co-designed capability boundary for the ``tasks.py`` de-god program
(``tasks-py-degod-01KWF08S``) and reused by Wave 2. The four ports are
**stratified** (research D2):

* **Program-reference ports** (Wave 2 reuses these):
  - :class:`FsReader` — coordination **READ** authority (C-001). Never conflates
    with the write authority.
  - :class:`CoordCommitRouter` — coordination **WRITE** authority, exposing
    **two capability methods over two structurally disjoint real seams**
    (:meth:`~CoordCommitRouter.commit_status` over
    ``emit_status_transition_transactional`` and
    :meth:`~CoordCommitRouter.commit_artifact` over ``commit_for_mission``).
    NOT a fused ``commit()`` — the Wave-2 consumers use disjoint halves
    (``implement.py`` = status only; ``acceptance`` = artifact only; ``move_task``
    = both), so a single fused method is re-cut in Wave 2 (the C-006 failure).
* **Mission-local seams** (scaffolding for ``tasks.py`` testability only; #2173
  DROPs both, so they are explicitly NOT advertised as program-reference ports):
  - :class:`GitOps` — porcelain reads.
  - :class:`Render` — dual-arm output (``human`` + ``json_envelope``).

Injection contract (C-005 / research D5): every orchestrator is
``_do_<cmd>(..., *, ports: TasksPorts | None = None)``; ``None`` builds the Real
bundle via :func:`default_ports`. The Typer ``@app.command`` never sees ``ports``
(a Protocol-typed parameter on a decorated command collides with Typer
introspection). This WP delivers the boundary + the FR-010 dir-equivalence proof;
it does NOT thin the command bodies (that is WP06+).

Note: ``__all__`` is intentionally omitted. This module is imported directly by
the thin orchestrators and tests, while the former CLI-local path remains a
compatibility shim.
