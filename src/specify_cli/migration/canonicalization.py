"""Transformer-flavor rule pipeline for migration canonicalization.

Implements the ``chain-of-responsibility-rule-pipeline`` tactic (Transformer
flavor) as a typed Protocol + runner. Each rule is a pure function that checks
its own applicability, optionally transforms the state, and returns a
``CanonicalStepResult``. The runner threads state forward, accumulates actions,
and short-circuits on the first error.

Tactic references:
- ``chain-of-responsibility-rule-pipeline`` (Transformer flavor): each rule
  has contract ``(state, ctx) -> StepResult(state', actions, error?)``.
  Order matters; runner short-circuits on ``error``.
- ``refactoring-extract-first-order-concept``: each rule is a first-order
  concept with a single responsibility.

Usage::

    from specify_cli.migration.canonicalization import (
        CanonicalRule,
        CanonicalStepResult,
        CanonicalPipelineResult,
        MigrationContext,
        apply_rules,
    )

    _MY_RULES: tuple[CanonicalRule[Row], ...] = (
        _rule_one,
        _rule_two,
    )

    result = apply_rules(_MY_RULES, dict(data), ctx)

.. note::
    ``MigrationContext.generated_ids`` is the **one** mutable element on the
    context — by design, rules append minted IDs so the caller observes them.
    This is a documented exception to the immutability invariant; rules MUST
    use ``.append()`` only and MUST NOT replace the list reference.
