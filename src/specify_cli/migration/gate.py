"""Schema version gate for the Spec Kitty CLI.

``check_schema_version`` is called as a typer callback before every command
dispatch.  It delegates to ``compat.planner.plan()`` which decides whether the
project is compatible with this CLI build.

Exempted commands that always pass through:
  - ``upgrade``  (fixes the problem)
  - ``init``     (creates the project, no existing metadata yet)
  - ``--version`` / ``--help``  (handled by typer's eager options before our callback)

def _build_command_path(invoked_subcommand: str | None = None) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    """Build the full command path from sys.argv, e.g. ('agent', 'mission', 'branch-context').

    Uses ``sys.argv[1:]`` to construct the full path by collecting positional
    tokens until the first flag (``--something`` or ``-x``).  When
    ``invoked_subcommand`` is given and *does not match* the first positional
    token in ``sys.argv`` (e.g. tests invoke the gate directly without setting
    ``sys.argv``), the function falls back to ``(invoked_subcommand,)`` so that
    the safety registry can still classify single-level commands correctly.

    This two-phase approach guarantees that:
    - Real CLI runs with nested subcommands (``spec-kitty agent mission
      branch-context``) produce the full tuple ``("agent", "mission",
      "branch-context")``, which the registry can match.
    - Direct gate-function calls in tests (or typer callbacks that only know
      the top-level ``invoked_subcommand``) still work without requiring every
      caller to monkeypatch ``sys.argv``.

    Args:
        invoked_subcommand: The top-level subcommand name reported by typer's
            ``ctx.invoked_subcommand``, or ``None`` when no subcommand was
            given (e.g. bare ``spec-kitty`` invocation).

    Returns:
        A tuple of positional command-path segments, e.g.
        ``("agent", "mission", "branch-context")``.  Empty when no subcommand
        is present.

    Examples::

        sys.argv = ["spec-kitty", "agent", "mission", "branch-context", "--json"]
        _build_command_path("agent") -> ("agent", "mission", "branch-context")
