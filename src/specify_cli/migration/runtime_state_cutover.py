"""Cutover orchestration: seed runtime state, fail-closed verify, atomic flip.

The **single** invocable spine step (research D-01): one shared
:func:`cutover_mission` helper implements ``backfill -> fail-closed verify ->
atomic per-mission ``status_phase`` flip`` so the load-bearing atomicity lives in
exactly one place. Both the operator CLI (``spec-kitty migrate
backfill-runtime-state``) and — in a later WP — the upgrade migration reuse this
helper; neither re-implements verify-then-flip.

Fail-closed contract (FR-003 / NFR-001 / INV-1):

* :func:`cutover_mission` is the **sole production writer** of ``meta.json``
  ``status_phase``.
* It flips to the snapshot-authority value **only** after an ``ok`` verify. The
  flip phase (:func:`_flip_phase`) is structurally unreachable on a non-``ok``
  verify, a :class:`MigrationOrderingError`, or a per-mission backfill error — so
  a divergent-state mission is *never* flipped (zero silent data loss).
* The write target resolves via :func:`canonicalize_feature_dir` — never
  ``Path.cwd()`` and never a raw worktree/root alias — so no ``status_phase`` (or
  event) write ever lands at the repo root (INV-5 / C-003 / #2815). This helper
  adds **no** event-write path of its own: all seed events go through the backfill
  library, which already canonicalizes.
* (placement-port-residuals-closure-01KYDEF0 FR-001) That target is additionally
  ENFORCED against the placement port's own answer
  (:func:`~mission_runtime.resolve_artifact_surface`): a resolved PRIMARY home
  that disagrees with the write target fails closed
  (:class:`PlacementMismatchError`, writes nothing); a resolver *failure* (no
  enclosing git repo, an ambiguous handle, a deleted coordination branch, or an
  unresolvable action context) on a well-formed legacy mission degrades to the
  caller-supplied target instead of aborting the cutover (NFR-002).
  :func:`cutover_mission` itself still RAISES :class:`PlacementMismatchError`
  (per-mission fail-close, C-WRITER-1) — the corpus walkers
  (:func:`cutover_repo` and the upgrade migration's ``_cutover_corpus``) catch
  it PER MISSION so one mis-routed mission never strands the missions sorted
  after it (landing-fold finding 1).

Idempotency (NFR-002 / INV-4): the backfill mints byte-identical deterministic
seed ids (a re-run seeds nothing) and :func:`_flip_phase` short-circuits when the
phase is already snapshot-authority, so a second run seeds nothing and re-flips
nothing (byte-stable).
