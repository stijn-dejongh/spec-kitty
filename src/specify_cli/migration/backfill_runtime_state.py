"""Migration engine: backfill runtime state into the event log + fail-closed verify.

Realises **IC-03** (per-field backfill + fail-closed verify) and gates the reader
cutover for every downstream field vertical (WP05-WP09). The pinned migration
order this module implements the *first two steps* of is::

    backfill -> verify(pre-strip, FAIL-CLOSED) -> reader cutover -> writer cutover
             -> strip mutable fields -> delete fallbacks -> land hash guard

This WP owns **backfill + verify + the ``MUTABLE_FIELDS`` field-moves** only. It
does **not** perform reader/writer cutover (the field verticals do) and does
**not** delete the legacy fallbacks (WP10 does, gated on this backfill).

Backfill (:func:`backfill_runtime_state`)
    For every WP in the live corpus, reconstruct the frontmatter/checkbox runtime
    state that is about to be stripped into seed events:

    - the **claim** state (``shell_pid`` / ``shell_pid_created_at`` / ``agent``)
      rides a seed ``planned -> claimed`` :class:`StatusEvent` whose
      ``policy_metadata`` sidecar the WP01 reducer folds into the snapshot slots
      (FR-004 claim path);
    - ``assignee`` / ``tracker_refs`` / subtask completion / ``review`` ride seed
      :class:`InnerStateChanged` annotations with a typed :class:`WPInnerStateDelta`.

    Every seed ``event_id`` is a **deterministic namespaced ULID**
    (``mission_id + wp_id + field``), so a re-run mints byte-identical ids and the
    idempotency check (skip an id already on disk) makes a second run seed nothing
    (NFR-002). When a WP already has transition or annotation history, every
    seed timestamp is clamped strictly below its earliest raw ``(at, event_id)``
    key. With no history, the existing claimed/synthesized anchor remains the
    deterministic fallback.

    **Claim-anchor synthesis (#2848).** The ``claimed`` timestamp a WP's other
    seeds clamp to normally comes from the event log (:func:`_claim_anchors`).
    When that log is missing or truncated but the WP's frontmatter still carries
    real claim state (``agent`` / ``shell_pid`` / ``shell_pid_created_at``),
    treating the WP as "never claimed" would silently drop that data (the pre-fix
    behavior: :func:`verify_backfill` returned a vacuous ``ok=True, wp_count=0``
    and the mission still flipped to snapshot authority with an empty runtime).
    :func:`_resolve_anchor` instead synthesizes a deterministic anchor from the
    frontmatter itself (``shell_pid_created_at``, falling back to the mission's
    ``meta.json`` ``created_at``) so the claim is seeded and recoverable via
    :func:`~specify_cli.status.wp_view.reconstruct_wp_view`. A WP with no claim
    fields at all (or claim fields but no honest timestamp anywhere to anchor
    them to) remains genuinely never-claimed and is skipped, as before.

    NOTE on the emit seam: the public :func:`~specify_cli.status.emit.emit_inner_state_changed`
    mints a *random* ULID, which cannot satisfy the deterministic-idempotent seed
    contract. The backfill therefore reuses the exact internals that API is built
    on — the sanctioned ``wp_state.annotate()`` non-transition seam plus the
    durability-verified store append (:func:`append_annotations_atomic_verified`)
    — but supplies its own deterministic ``event_id``. The seeds are ordinary
    WP01 events: the reducer folds them into the snapshot with no special-casing.

Verify (:func:`verify_backfill`) — **fail-closed**
    Asserts every value produced by the OLD frontmatter/checkbox reader exists in
    its deterministic seed row, independently witnesses all three claim-borne
    slots, and requires an exact compatibility repair when a persisted pre-floor
    seed corrupts current state. Legitimate later events remain authoritative.
    The proof reads the **un-stripped** frontmatter:
    :func:`strip_mutable_fields` MUST NOT run before verify. The verifier also
    checks WP/count integrity, rejects corrupt deterministic seed rows, and raises
    :class:`MigrationOrderingError`. Any mismatch, ordering violation, or corrupt
    seed **aborts before reader cutover** — never a warning.

Honesty bound (no-data-loss)
    "No data loss" is asserted against deterministic seed-row payload parity and
    WP/count integrity, **not** temporal fidelity: backfilled subtask-completion
    timestamps are historical ordering anchors, seed ULIDs are content-namespaced
    (not chronological), and a later legitimate annotation may supersede a seed.
    The contract holds only because **no consumer reads subtask-completion time or
    relies on seed-ULID chronological order** — this is asserted as an explicit
    precondition in the test-suite.

    Seed ``event_id``s are deterministic namespaced ULIDs. Two ordering rules
    compose here, and both must hold:

    1. **Shared per-WP floor** (:func:`_resolve_seed_anchor`): when the WP already
       carries authentic transition *or annotation* history, every seed — the
       claim carrier and each reconstructed annotation alike — uses one shared
       timestamp strictly below the earliest raw reducer key. With no history at
       all, the claimed/synthesized anchor contract is unchanged and the
       annotations share that anchor, so their fold ordering (post-transition,
       via the WP01 event-kind partition) stays deterministic.
    2. **Retroactive claim pin** (:func:`_retro_claim_at`): the claim
       *transition*'s ``at`` is additionally pinned strictly before the WP's
       earliest recorded transition, so a retroactive metadata carrier can never
       win the reducer's ``(at, event_id)`` fold and regress a finished WP back
       to ``claimed`` (#2985 / #1883). Rule 1 already satisfies this whenever the
       WP has history, so the pin is a belt-and-braces floor for the anchor
       paths rule 1 leaves untouched — it is never allowed to move a seed
       *later*.

    The carrier is minted only for the claim slots authentic history does not
    already hold (:func:`_unmigrated_claim_slots`); an already-migrated claim has
    nothing left to migrate, so re-stating it would be pure write amplification
    on the otherwise lane-neutral ``accept`` seam. Suppression here cannot hide
    data loss: :func:`_verify_claim_slot_witnesses` derives its denominator from
    :func:`read_legacy_runtime` and the same authentic-history probe, never from
    the rows this function emits.

    Subtask-completion ``at`` is clamped to the resolved anchor (fictional time,
    documented). The truthful ``review_artifact_override_at`` is preserved
    *inside* the delta's
    :class:`ReviewOverride`, not on the envelope.

    When the event log carries no anchor for a WP that nonetheless has claim
    state in frontmatter, the anchor is synthesized (:func:`_resolve_anchor`) so
    a missing/truncated event log never silently drops a real claim (#2848). A
    WP with neither an event-log anchor nor synthesizable claim state is
    genuinely never-claimed and is skipped (warned, not failed).

    *read_dir* is the canonical PRIMARY leg passed through to
    :func:`_resolve_anchor` for the synthesis fallback (NFR-004 / R5) and to
    :func:`_mission_id` (#2966 part-1) — it is intentionally distinct from
