"""The single canonical authority for commit-surface decisions (mission ``coord-commit-surface-authority``).

Home for the ONE rule every commit-bearing locus consumes — create-time topology
selection, the ``spec-commit`` / task-command shell helpers, and
``commit_router._commit_partition_group``. It lives in ``coordination/`` (NOT
``cli/``) so both the ``cli.commands.agent.*`` callers AND ``coordination.*``
(``commit_router``) can import it without a cycle: ``coordination/`` never imports
``cli/`` (the layering guard in ``tests/coordination/test_surface_authority.py``
asserts this). Every dependency the rule needs — ``MissionTopology`` /
``routes_through_coordination`` (routing), ``is_primary_artifact_kind`` (the
PRIMARY vs COORD partition), the caller-resolved ``primary_protected`` bool — sits
at or below the coordination layer (all via ``mission_runtime`` public imports,
per the shared-package boundary).

This module is **pure**: no filesystem, git, or network I/O. Callers resolve the
inputs (topology, primary target branch, its protection, the current checkout, the
artifact kind) and consume the returned :class:`SurfaceVerdict`. Freezing the rule
here — with the behaviour tests in
``tests/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/test_tasks_surface_authority.py`` and
``tests/coordination/test_surface_authority.py`` — is what lets the
consumer refactors (WP02/WP03/WP04) align to ONE authority without drifting the
observable per-command behavior (contract ``authoritative-surface.md``; NFR-001,
INV-1..INV-4).

    ``{artifact_kind, topology, primary_protected}`` ⇒ identical verdict (INV-4);
    exit codes legitimately differ *by kind*, never by hardcoded per-command logic.

    Routing mirrors ``commit_router``'s ``use_coord`` exactly: a coordination

    ``LANES_WITH_COORD``) routes to coordination; every PRIMARY-partition kind, and
    every kind under a non-coord topology, routes to the primary target.

        1. Coordination-kind + coord topology + protected primary →
           ``surface="coordination"``, :class:`RouteToCoord` (exit 0; the redundant
           primary commit is suppressed, the coord commit is authoritative).

        3. Primary-kind (or any kind with no coord route) on a PROTECTED primary →

    ``NoOp`` and wrong-surface :class:`Refuse` outcomes are runtime facts (staging

            target protection, not the checkout — carried for consumer parity/logging).
        artifact_kind: The kind being committed (classified PRIMARY vs COORD).
        coord_ref: The concrete coordination branch that owns the commit, when the
