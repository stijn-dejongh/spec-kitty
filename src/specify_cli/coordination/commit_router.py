"""Mission-aware planning-commit router (FR-001/002/005).

Extracted from ``cli/commands/agent/mission.py`` to provide a single canonical
``commit_for_mission`` entry point that:

1. Resolves the placement via ``mission_runtime.resolve_placement_only``.
2. If the resolved placement is COORDINATION and the policy marks the target ref
   as protected, materialises the coordination worktree on demand and stages the
   artifacts there before committing.
3. Otherwise commits directly to the primary checkout (flattened / unprotected).

This module owns the extraction described in WP02 / IC-02. The three formerly
open-coded inline commit tails in ``mission.py`` (gap-analysis, generator-config,
finalize-tasks) are folded into this entry point (T027 / #2056).

Design basis: ``plan.md`` (IC-02), ADR ``2026-06-21-1``.

C-001 (no parallel materialiser): every coordination worktree materialisation
goes through the single canonical ``CoordinationWorkspace.resolve()`` path.
NFR-001 (#1718 create-window): materialisation happens at the COMMIT boundary,
not at read time.

    Module-public (NOT in ``__all__`` — reviewer ruling B3, WP05 cycle 1): this
    name has no cross-module ``src/`` caller yet, and the symbol-level
    dead-code gate (``tests/architectural/test_no_dead_symbols.py``) requires a
    caller OUTSIDE the declaring module for any ``__all__`` member — an
    intra-module reference (:func:`_group_files_by_partition` calls this
    function below) does not satisfy it. Per the gate's own sanctioned fix
    option 2, this stays a plain, non-underscore, non-exported module
    function: importable by name (``from specify_cli.coordination.
    commit_router import partition_for_mission_path``) the moment a real
    caller needs it (WP16's accept dirty gate), at which point that WP adds it
    back to ``__all__`` and re-exports it. Until then it is NOT part of this
    module's declared public surface.

    :func:`_group_files_by_partition` calls this function too (not a parallel
    copy); their verdicts can never drift apart.

    ``repo_root`` / ``owned`` are accepted for interface symmetry with this
    module's other kind-aware public helpers, but are not consulted: the
    underlying residue classifier,
    :func:`~specify_cli.coordination.coherence.is_coord_residue_churn`, is
    deliberately called the SAME topology-blind way
    :func:`_group_files_by_partition` has always called it (no ``topology``
    argument) — passing one here would risk a verdict that disagrees with the
    router's own grouping, the exact drift this predicate exists to prevent.
    A caller that needs a topology-aware (e.g. destructive dirty-gate) verdict
    calls :func:`~specify_cli.coordination.coherence.is_coord_residue_churn`
    directly with its own resolved topology, per that function's own

    """Group ``files`` by PARTITION (PRIMARY vs COORD), not by exact kind (T023).

    FR-005 / C-007 (#2650 / #2533): each file's partition membership is
    decided by the SAME absolute authority the read-side (``implement_cores.
    py::resolve_precondition_ref``) and write-side cli
    (``implement.py::_partition_files_for_commit``) sites already use —
    :func:`~specify_cli.coordination.coherence.is_coord_residue_churn` — instead
    of the divergent ``kind_for_mission_file(file) or kind`` classifier this
    helper used before. A ``None`` classification (``meta.json``, an
    unrecognised path) is NOT coord-residue, so it now routes PRIMARY
    UNCONDITIONALLY — never falling back to (and never inheriting) the
    caller's own partition. This closes the #2533-class hole: previously a
    ``kind=None`` file bundled under a COORD-kind caller (e.g. a ``move_task``
    status commit) silently joined the caller's COORD group instead of its
    own (PRIMARY) home.

    The buckets are ABSOLUTE, not relative to the caller: a PRIMARY-partition
    file always resolves against a PRIMARY ref and a COORD-partition file
    always resolves against the COORD ref, regardless of which partition
    ``kind`` (the caller's own artifact kind) belongs to. ``resolve_placement_
    only`` is still the sole ref-resolution authority for both buckets (the
    swap is classifier-only, not ref-resolution) — see
    :func:`_representative_kind_for_bucket` for how a concrete kind is chosen
    per bucket to drive that call.

    Coordless-topology coincidence (regression guard, #2155): under a topology
    that does not route through coordination (``SINGLE_BRANCH`` / ``LANES``),
    EVERY kind's placement — primary or coord-partition — resolves to the SAME
    ``target_branch``. Splitting a genuinely mixed batch into two commits in
    that case would be a pure regression (an existing atomic-commit caller,
    ``move_task``'s ``WORK_PACKAGE_TASK`` + ``STATUS_STATE`` bundle, expects
    ONE commit) with no benefit — both buckets' own ref IS the same ref. So
    when both buckets are non-empty their refs are resolved and compared, and
    the groups collapse back into the historical single-group call when they
    coincide; only a genuine ref DIVERGENCE is split.

    Returns a list of ``(representative_kind, files)`` groups:

    - Zero groups when ``files`` is empty.
    - One group ``(kind, files)`` when every file shares the caller's OWN
      partition (the byte-identical-to-today fast path — no
      ``resolve_placement_only`` call is made in this branch).
    - One group ``(representative_kind, files)`` when every file belongs to
      the SAME (single) partition even though it disagrees with the caller's
      own ``kind`` — the #2533-class fix: this partition's OWN ref is used,
      never the caller's.
    - One group ``(kind, files)`` when both partitions are present but
      resolve to the SAME ref (the coordless-topology collapse above).
    - Two groups when the batch is genuinely mixed AND the two partitions'
      refs diverge (the #2404 defect shape).

    - ``SKIP_ANALYSIS_REPORT``: the re-homed ``analysis-report.md`` (FR-003) —
      never a second copy on the coordination worktree.
    - ``DROP_FOREIGN_WORKTREE``: a path under ``.worktrees/`` that is NOT
      directly in this worktree (a sibling mission's coord worktree, a worktree
      nested inside this one, or an ``analysis-report.md`` anywhere under
      ``.worktrees/``) — dropped entirely. Kept distinct from the SKIP
      members on purpose: a SKIP is a copy-destination-aware decision the act
      step may translate into a different action, while a foreign worktree
      path has no copy destination to translate.
    - ``COPY``: staged into the coordination worktree at the mirrored relative
      path (the only outcome the caller still derives ``dst`` for) — the
      LEGACY ``shutil.copy2``, unconditional, for every non-log COORD kind
      (``TRACER_FILE`` / ``REVIEW_CYCLE`` / ``ISSUE_MATRIX`` / ``ACCEPTANCE_

      **Reviewer ruling (WP05 cycle 1, B1, DECISION plan.design.translate-if-
      present-kinds):** an earlier revision of this WP made the act step prefer
      an EXISTING owning (coordination) copy over a fresh one for these four
      kinds ("the owning copy wins"). That silently dropped every writer's
      update for a kind whose writer still writes the ROOT copy (none of
      TRACER_FILE/REVIEW_CYCLE/ISSUE_MATRIX/ACCEPTANCE_MATRIX has migrated to
      ``write_dir`` yet — WP08 migrates REVIEW_CYCLE, WP10 migrates TRACER_FILE
      and ISSUE_MATRIX, WP15 migrates ACCEPTANCE_MATRIX) — a real data-loss

      legacy overwrite (root always wins, exactly pre-WP05) until each kind's
      writer is migrated to ``write_dir`` in its own WP, which is also where
      the "owning copy wins" switch is re-introduced, one kind at a time.
      STATUS_STATE / DECISION_LOG are UNAFFECTED by this reversion — they are
      genuinely append-only logs with no legacy root writer at all, so T027's

    this one function; the old name survives only as a backward-compat alias at the

    - Translating a root-checkout ``STATUS_STATE`` / ``DECISION_LOG`` path to its
      owning (coordination) copy instead of skipping it (WP05 T027, D7) — ONLY
      when ``mission_slug`` is given; a 3-positional caller with no ``meta.json``
      fixture keeps the historical bare skip (#1589).
    - ``TRACER_FILE`` / ``REVIEW_CYCLE`` / ``ISSUE_MATRIX`` / ``ACCEPTANCE_MATRIX``
      keep the UNCONDITIONAL legacy ``shutil.copy2`` overwrite (reviewer ruling
      B1 / DECISION plan.design.translate-if-present-kinds, WP05 cycle 1): none
      of their writers has migrated to ``write_dir`` yet, so "prefer the
      existing coordination copy" would silently drop every writer's root-copy
      update. The "owning copy wins" switch moves to the WP that migrates each
      kind's writer (WP08: review-cycle; WP10: tracer, issue-matrix; WP15:
      finalize, acceptance-matrix), one kind at a time.
    - Skipping the re-homed ``analysis-report.md`` (FR-003) — see
      :func:`_classify_stage_path`.
    - Skipping worktrees-nested paths (#FR-035).
    - Residue cleanup for ``primary_paths_created_this_invocation`` (R6 / #1814).

    ``mission_slug`` / ``owned`` are KEYWORD-ONLY and OPTIONAL (binding
    correction, seam map): several existing unit-test fixtures call this
    helper with exactly three positionals and no ``meta.json`` on disk, so an
    unconditional ``write_dir`` resolution would raise for them. Only a caller
    that supplies ``mission_slug`` gets the T027 translation; every other
    caller is byte-identical to the pre-WP05 behaviour.

    The per-path decision lives in :func:`_classify_stage_path` (T005,
    campsite-clean WP01); the per-path ACTION (including the ``write_dir``
    I/O for a translate plan) lives in :func:`_act_on_stage_plan` (WP05 T027,
    WP04 reviewer binding note: never put ``write_dir`` I/O in the

    (and the artifacts, written to the main checkout, are copied across for
    staging, skipping coord-owned status files, #1589). For a coord-less topology
    the destination is already HEAD of the main checkout, so it is used directly.

    write-surface-coherence WP03 / T014: this helper is partition-aware. The
    coord-staging body runs ONLY for coordination-partition artifact kinds; a
    PRIMARY kind (the default — every caller here commits planning artifacts)
    resolves to the primary ``target_branch`` for every topology, so it commits
    directly from the primary checkout with NO coord transit (FR-003 / C-005).
    This is the genuine invariant guard (T019): a PRIMARY-partition kind must
    NEVER reach the coord-staging body below — deleting or weakening this
    early return re-opens the planning→coord mis-route the partition exists to
    forbid, so it is preserved verbatim across the rename.
