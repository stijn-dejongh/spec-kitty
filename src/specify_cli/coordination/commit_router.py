"""Mission-aware planning-commit router (FR-001/002/005).

Extracted from ``cli/commands/agent/mission.py`` to provide a single canonical
``commit_for_mission`` entry point that:

1. Resolves the placement via ``mission_runtime.resolve_placement_only``.
2. If the resolved placement is COORDINATION and the policy marks the target ref
   as protected, materialises the coordination worktree on demand and stages the
   artifacts there before committing.
3. Otherwise commits directly to the primary checkout (flattened / unprotected).

This module owns the extraction described in WP02 / IC-02. The three formerly
open-coded inline commit tails in ``mission.py`` (gap-analysis, generator-config,
finalize-tasks) are folded into this entry point (T027 / #2056).

Design basis: ``plan.md`` (IC-02), ADR ``2026-06-21-1``.

C-001 (no parallel materialiser): every coordination worktree materialisation
goes through the single canonical ``CoordinationWorkspace.resolve()`` path.
NFR-001 (#1718 create-window): materialisation happens at the COMMIT boundary,
not at read time.

    decided by the SAME absolute authority the read-side (``implement_cores.
    py::resolve_precondition_ref``) and write-side cli
    (``implement.py::_partition_files_for_commit``) sites already use —
    :func:`~specify_cli.coordination.coherence.is_coord_residue_churn` — instead
    of the divergent ``kind_for_mission_file(file) or kind`` classifier this
    helper used before. A ``None`` classification (``meta.json``, an
    unrecognised path) is NOT coord-residue, so it now routes PRIMARY
    UNCONDITIONALLY — never falling back to (and never inheriting) the
    caller's own partition. This closes the #2533-class hole: previously a
    ``kind=None`` file bundled under a COORD-kind caller (e.g. a ``move_task``
    status commit) silently joined the caller's COORD group instead of its
    own (PRIMARY) home.

    The buckets are ABSOLUTE, not relative to the caller: a PRIMARY-partition
    file always resolves against a PRIMARY ref and a COORD-partition file
    always resolves against the COORD ref, regardless of which partition
    ``kind`` (the caller's own artifact kind) belongs to. ``resolve_placement_
    only`` is still the sole ref-resolution authority for both buckets (the
    swap is classifier-only, not ref-resolution) — see
    :func:`_representative_kind_for_bucket` for how a concrete kind is chosen
    per bucket to drive that call.

    Coordless-topology coincidence (regression guard, #2155): under a topology
    that does not route through coordination (``SINGLE_BRANCH`` / ``LANES``),
    EVERY kind's placement — primary or coord-partition — resolves to the SAME
    ``target_branch``. Splitting a genuinely mixed batch into two commits in
    that case would be a pure regression (an existing atomic-commit caller,
    ``move_task``'s ``WORK_PACKAGE_TASK`` + ``STATUS_STATE`` bundle, expects
    ONE commit) with no benefit — both buckets' own ref IS the same ref. So
    when both buckets are non-empty their refs are resolved and compared, and
    the groups collapse back into the historical single-group call when they
    coincide; only a genuine ref DIVERGENCE is split.

    Returns a list of ``(representative_kind, files)`` groups:

    - Zero groups when ``files`` is empty.
    - One group ``(kind, files)`` when every file shares the caller's OWN
      partition (the byte-identical-to-today fast path — no
      ``resolve_placement_only`` call is made in this branch).
    - One group ``(representative_kind, files)`` when every file belongs to
      the SAME (single) partition even though it disagrees with the caller's
      own ``kind`` — the #2533-class fix: this partition's OWN ref is used,
      never the caller's.
    - One group ``(kind, files)`` when both partitions are present but
      resolve to the SAME ref (the coordless-topology collapse above).
    - Two groups when the batch is genuinely mixed AND the two partitions'
      refs diverge (the #2404 defect shape).
