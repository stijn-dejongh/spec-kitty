"""Coordination-branch coherence: the single strand-derivation + repair owner.

Mission ``merge-coord-rollback-transactionality`` (#2786 + #2367-B), FR-009.

The strand-derivation and the git-revert repair are **coordination-domain**
knowledge and get exactly one home here, consumed by all three call-sites — the
marker-persist site, the resume heal-gate, and the ``doctor coordination`` check
— so the three never drift (the #2786-C seed).

Two load-bearing layering rules keep this module clean:

* The reader (:func:`coord_incoherent_done_wps`) derives from the **committed
  coordination ref** via ``coordination.status_service.EventLogReadContract`` —
  never the working tree. A committed-vs-working diff at a #2786 mark point is
  empty (the rollback restores primary paths, not the coord worktree) and would
  silently drop the strand.
* The repair (:func:`repair_coord_strand`) imports ``_make_merge_env``
  **function-locally**. A module-top ``from specify_cli.lanes.consolidation import
  _make_merge_env`` creates the cycle ``merge.executor -> coordination.coherence
  -> lanes.merge -> merge.config``. There is intentionally **no** module-top
  ``coordination -> merge`` / ``coordination -> lanes`` import in this file.

    r"""Return True for spec-kitty's OWN bookkeeping files (retired IC-07a).

    WP11 retirement: absorbs the retired ``mission_runtime`` self-bookkeeping
    predicate (#2102 / G-5 invariant) as the self-bookkeeping LEG of the owner union — spec-kitty's
    OWN mission-identity ``meta.json`` (``kitty-specs/<mission>/meta.json``, depth-exact,
    including under a monorepo subdirectory, plus the legacy ``.kittify/meta.json``), the
    encoding-provenance ``.kittify/encoding-provenance/global.jsonl``, and
    ``kitty-ops/<ULID>.jsonl`` Op-record orphans (#2251) are spec-kitty's own bookkeeping,
    not mission planning artifacts, and their churn must not block a dirty-state gate.

    #4933: the ``meta.json`` leg was previously exempted by BASENAME ALONE
    (``PurePosixPath(normalized).name == "meta.json"``), so an operator's OWN file that
    merely happens to be named ``meta.json`` anywhere in the tree (e.g.
    ``src/app/meta.json``) was silently treated as bookkeeping and its dirty churn
    was invisible to every destructive/refusal gate that consults this predicate —
    ``spec-kitty consolidate`` would ``reset --hard`` the primary checkout or
    ``worktree remove --force`` a lane worktree over that edit and exit 0. The
    exemption is now depth-exact: only ``(?:^|/)kitty-specs/[^/]+/meta\.json$``
    (Spec Kitty's own mission metadata) and ``(?:^|/)\.kittify/meta\.json$`` (the
    legacy location, read only by ``tracker.py`` and an old migration) are exempt.
    A user ``meta.json`` anywhere else — including
    ``kitty-specs/<mission>/research/meta.json``, which is one level too deep to
    match the mission-root anchor — is real dirt again.

    FIX-M2-05: also recognizes the dossier snapshot
    (``<feature_dir>/.kittify/dossiers/<mission_slug>/snapshot-latest.json``,
    :func:`specify_cli.status.preflight.is_dossier_snapshot`) as self-bookkeeping
    churn. ``contracts/dossier-snapshot-ownership.md`` (D1/D2, mission
    ``charter-e2e-827-followups-01KQAJA0`` / #845) already ratifies this exact
    "excluded from version control, belt-and-suspenders filtered from every dirty-
    state computation" policy for ``agent tasks move-task``'s preflight; this
    predicate is the missing belt-and-suspenders leg for the OTHER gates that
    consult :func:`is_toolchain_generated_churn` (``git/ref_advance.py``,
    ``bulk_edit/diff_check.py``, ``review/dirty_classifier.py``, …) — the same
    class of "invisible to one gate, fatal at another" split this function's own
    C7 precedent (see :func:`is_toolchain_generated_churn`) already exists to
    close.

    Exposed as its own predicate (not folded silently into
    :func:`is_toolchain_generated_churn`'s body) because three consumers
    (``merge/git_probes.py``, ``cli/commands/agent/mission_record_analysis.py``,
    ``acceptance/__init__.py``) already apply the coord-residue leg SEPARATELY under
    their own topology-gated conditional (:func:`is_coord_residue_churn`
    unconditionally projects ``MissionTopology.COORD`` — it is only correct to consult
    under an already-established coordination topology). Routing those call sites
    through the full union would silently widen the residue drop to run
    unconditionally / unscoped, which is a behaviour change this retirement must NOT
    make (C6). This predicate is therefore the precise, self-bookkeeping-only
    replacement for the retired symbol; :func:`is_toolchain_generated_churn` composes
    it with the residue authority for callers that want the full union in one call.

    The filename / suffix / regex literals are function-local (not module-level
    ``frozenset`` / ``tuple`` / ``re.compile`` assignments) so the R-014
    exemption-registry scan — which only walks module-level assignments
    (``tests/architectural/test_exemption_registry_ratchet.py``) — does not treat this

    **Topology (C-3 / D8 / #4978).** ``topology`` is the mission's STORED
    :class:`~mission_runtime.MissionTopology`; it is threaded straight to the
    residue authority :func:`~mission_runtime.kind_is_coordination_residue`,
    which returns ``False`` for the two coord-less cells
    (:attr:`~mission_runtime.MissionTopology.SINGLE_BRANCH` /
    :attr:`~mission_runtime.MissionTopology.LANES`) — so on a lanes/single_branch
    mission a coord-partition-KIND artifact (``issue-matrix.md``, the append-only
    status log, ``acceptance-matrix.json``, tracer/decision dirs) is NEVER
    residue and is never ``reset --hard``ed as such. Any caller that KNOWS the
    mission's topology — above all the merge dirty gate, which does the
    destructive ``reset --hard`` — MUST pass it; the classifier can no longer
    reach a topology-blind verdict silently.

    ``topology=None`` is an EXPLICIT, overridable backward-compatibility default
    that projects ``MissionTopology.COORD`` (the historical hard-coded behaviour
    the pre-C-3 callers — all inherently coord-context: coord staging, the
    coord-branch implement filter, coord auto-rebase, acceptance — relied on).
    It is deliberately NOT a silent internal assumption: the parameter exists so
    a topology-aware caller overrides it, and the merge dirty gate does.

    **C-008 topology-less callers (coord-artifact-single-home-01M3V4BE WP12,
    #5023 — RULED, Decision Moment ``plan.design.ledger-topology-less-verdict``).**
    Six call sites never thread a ``topology`` through this predicate (so they
    hit the ``MissionTopology.COORD`` default above); four of those also never
    thread ``mission_slug``: ``cli/commands/agent/tasks_move_task.py::
    _drop_lane_coord_residue``, ``cli/commands/agent/tasks_shared.py::
    _list_wp_branch_mission_specs_changes``, ``cli/commands/implement.py::
    _partition_files_for_commit`` / ``_guard_planning_commit_partition``, and
    ``lanes/auto_rebase.py::_is_coordination_owned_artifact`` pass neither;
    ``coordination/commit_router.py::partition_for_mission_path`` and
    ``consolidation/executor.py``'s post-merge invariant gate pass
    ``mission_slug`` but still never ``topology``. WP12's reclassification of
    ``MissionArtifactKind.DECISION_LEDGER`` out of the COORD partition means NO
    topology value makes :func:`~mission_runtime.kind_is_coordination_residue`
    return ``True`` for it any more — so all six now report the ledger as real
    work (never residue), with no code change needed here. The operator
    RULING: this holds under EVERY topology, ``lanes`` / ``single_branch``
    included — an uncommitted ``decisions/*`` ledger file is real work, never
    residue, at every one of these callers regardless of the Mission's actual
    stored topology. This is an accepted C-008 EXCEPTION (explicitly no
    compatibility set, no logic change here): the historical
    ``MissionTopology.COORD`` default already yields the ruled answer for this
    kind, so the exception is realised entirely by WP12's partition move, not
    by any resolution added to this function. See
    ``tests/coordination/test_ledger_topology_less_callers.py`` for the
    caller-level characterization pinning this across ``COORD`` / ``LANES`` /
    ``SINGLE_BRANCH``.

    WP12 retirement: absorbs the retired ``mission_runtime`` predicate
    ``is_coordination_artifact_residue_path`` (module
    ``src/mission_runtime/artifacts.py``, registry mechanism `IC-07b`) as the
    coord-residue LEG of the owner union. A path is coord-partition residue when
    its declared :class:`~mission_runtime.MissionArtifactKind` is a member of the
    COORD partition (the append-only status log/snapshot, ``issue-matrix.md``,
    ``acceptance-matrix.json``) — only THOSE kinds' stale primary-checkout copies
    are legitimate residue after a coordination-topology commit; every other
    recognised kind (planning SOURCE + finalized + identity docs, and, after the
    FR-003 re-home, ``analysis-report.md``) is a PRIMARY-partition kind whose
    stale primary copy is REAL dirt, never residue. An unrecognised path
    (``kind_for_mission_file`` returns ``None``) is never residue either.

    Behaviour-preserving reimplementation: composes the SAME two already-public
    ``mission_runtime`` primitives the retired predicate used internally —
    :func:`~mission_runtime.kind_for_mission_file` (the file→kind classifier) and
    :func:`~mission_runtime.kind_is_coordination_residue` (the kind/topology
    residue authority) — now threaded with the caller-supplied stored
    ``topology`` (C-3) instead of the retired hard-coded
    :attr:`~mission_runtime.MissionTopology.COORD`.

    The single repair operation both executor-resume (WP03) and ``doctor --fix``
    (WP04) call — homed in ``coordination`` so a diagnostic command never reaches
    into an executor-private helper (dependency inversion / DIR-044). Both callers
    are thin + equivalent: the primitive owns the worktree-existence check, the
    strand gate, the HEAD-freshness guard, the scoped clean-to-HEAD, and the revert.

    Ordered contract:

    0. **Unresolvable/pruned worktree (FR-007):** if ``coord_worktree`` does not
       exist, return ``worktree_missing=True`` (a distinguishable outcome) so the
       caller surfaces a STUCK diagnostic instead of looping the live-strand error.
    1. **Strand gate (NFR-002 idempotency):** the strand set is re-derived from the
       committed ref via :func:`coord_incoherent_done_wps` first. If the ref is
       already coherent the repair is a no-op — a double-heal cannot revert the
       revert. Running it N times yields a byte-stable coord ``status.events.jsonl``.
    2. **HEAD-freshness guard (concurrency TOCTOU):** :func:`_head_shape_is_expected`
       verifies HEAD has not advanced past the expected ``captured_sha + this
       merge's done`` shape before the ``captured_sha..HEAD`` revert; if it has
       (e.g. a concurrent healer already reverted), the repair refuses
       (``head_advanced=True``) rather than revert a wider range that re-applies
       ``done``.
    3. **Branch-identity guard (#4920-sibling):** :func:`_worktree_branch_matches_coord_ref`
       verifies the worktree's checked-out branch IS ``coord_ref`` (detached HEAD
       refuses too). Guards 1-2 are purely content-based and pass identically for a
       sibling branch created from the coord tip; without this check a
       ``git revert`` there would mutate that foreign branch and still report
       ``healed=True``. Refuses (``branch_mismatch=True``) before the revert.
    4. **Scoped clean-to-HEAD** (:func:`_clean_coord_status_paths_to_head`): AFTER
       the gates, BEFORE the revert, the mission's coord status paths are restored
       to HEAD so the forward revert can apply over the rollback's byte-restored
       (dirty) tree. Idempotent + no-op when clean; scoped to bound the blast radius.

    5. **SHA-scoped revert (#4973 / D4 S-B):** the heal reverts ONLY the strand's
       own recorded commits — the ones in ``captured_sha..HEAD`` that touched the
       mission's append-only status log (:func:`_recorded_strand_shas`) — each
       individually via :func:`_revert_recorded_sha`, newest-first. It is NEVER a
       content-blind ``git revert captured_sha..HEAD`` RANGE revert, which would
       also revert a third party's later commit that landed in the same range and
       erase it.

    **Transport (AC-B3/AC-F1):** per-SHA forward ``git revert --no-edit <sha>`` of
    each recorded strand commit in the coordination worktree, subprocess env via
    ``_make_merge_env`` (imported function-locally to avoid the import cycle).
    Each revert APPENDS a new commit — the append-only log invariant holds, history
    is never rewritten. NOT ``advance_branch_ref`` (it refuses the non-fast-forward
    move back to ``captured_sha`` by design); no raw ``git update-ref``.

    Args:
        coord_ref: Coordination branch ref used to re-derive coherence.
        captured_sha: Coord tip captured *before* the ``done`` bookkeeping commit;
            the ``git revert`` base.
