"""Legacy-mission resolution helpers for the bookkeeping transaction.

Extracted from ``transaction.py`` (WP08 campsite split, NFR-007) so the
coordination-branch write chokepoint lands in a smaller module. The move is
behaviour-free; ``transaction.py`` re-exports every public name below so
existing ``from specify_cli.coordination.transaction import _is_legacy_mission``
(and friends) imports keep resolving to these same functions.

Missions created before the coordination-branch topology landed do not carry
``coordination_branch`` in their ``meta.json``.  For those, the bookkeeping
write target is the operator's current LANE worktree + its checked-out branch.
Every other invariant of the transaction (pre-flight policy gate, lock, surgical
truncate rollback, outbound deferral) applies uniformly.  Only ``worktree_root``
and ``destination_ref`` differ.

Spec source: FR-017, FR-027, SC-11, C-001, C-005 (WP08 T035–T036).
