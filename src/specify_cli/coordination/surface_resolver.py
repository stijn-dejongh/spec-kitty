"""Canonical status-surface resolver for Spec Kitty missions.

This module is the **sole** canonical authority for coord-vs-primary
status-surface selection (FR-001 / FR-007). Every mission-surface read routes
through :func:`resolve_status_surface_with_anchor` — directly, or via the
blessed ``resolve_surface_dir_or_typed_error`` delegator (aggregate /
``mission_runtime``) — so no secondary fallback or parallel resolution
mechanism survives outside this seam. ``coordination/status_transition.py``'s
former path-shape topology predicates (the #1900 5th selection site) now
delegate to :func:`classify_worktree_topology` / :func:`is_registered_coord_worktree`
here; the C-002 topology-ratchet allowlist entry that reserved them is drained
(tests/architectural/test_topology_resolution_boundary.py). Any contributor
reaching for a parallel resolution path should treat this constraint as
load-bearing (NFR-003 compliance boundary).

The coord-empty case (a materialized-but-empty coordination worktree) is an
operator-decided **loud primary fallback** (Option B; FR-001 / FR-003 / #1716):
the resolver falls back to the primary checkout and proceeds. For a coord
mission WITH lanes (``MissionTopology.LANES_WITH_COORD`` — lane worktrees were
provisioned to write there), an empty coord root is genuinely unexpected, so
the fallback emits a single ``logging.WARNING``
(:data:`_COORD_EMPTY_FALLBACK_WARNING`) that names the stale-surface risk AND
both operator recovery paths — flatten (drop ``coordination_branch`` from
``meta.json``) OR run ``spec-kitty doctor workspaces --fix``. For a solo
coord mission with no lanes (``MissionTopology.COORD``), an empty coord root
is the EXPECTED steady state until the mission's first coordination-branch
write self-materializes it (#2533 / WP08 T029-T031): the fallback stays
quiet — no warning, no manual flatten prompted for a condition that is not an
error. It NEVER silently degrades for the genuinely unexpected case: the
warning makes that fallback observable so an operator or orchestrating agent
can intervene. The decision is recorded in
``docs/adr/3.x/2026-06-19-1-coord-empty-surface-fallback.md`` and bound
to this single resolver. (The sibling coord-*deleted* case stays a hard-fail —
:class:`CoordinationBranchDeleted`, #1848 — because a deleted branch carrying
unmerged status is data loss, not a degraded read.)

Coord-topology resolution happens **exactly once** (FR-036). The coord-aware
:func:`candidate_feature_dir_for_mission` resolver already returns the
coordination-worktree feature dir whenever that worktree is materialized on
disk; this module therefore never re-invokes that resolver on an
already-resolved root. The only remaining case it handles directly is the
transitional window where ``meta.json`` declares ``coordination_branch`` but
the coord worktree has not been materialized yet — there it composes the coord
path **once**, by hand, rather than resolving a second time. Re-running the
coord-aware resolver against a coord root nested
``.worktrees/<m>-coord/.worktrees/<m>-coord/…`` (the #1772 double-resolution
bug); building the path directly avoids that.

    Resolution is single-pass (FR-036): :func:`candidate_feature_dir_for_mission`
    — the coord-aware primitive that ``MissionStatus`` is also built on — is
    invoked **exactly once** and its result is carried as ``primary_anchor``.
    The surface path is derived from that same resolution:

    1. If the resolved dir is already inside a ``.worktrees/<m>-coord`` root, it
       is final — the surface lives there (never re-resolve; the #1772 nesting
       bug).
    2. Otherwise the resolver landed in the primary checkout. When that mission
       declares ``coordination_branch`` but the coord worktree is not yet
       materialized, compose the coord path **directly** (one derivation, via
       WP01's :func:`coord_feature_dir`). When the coord worktree root *is*
       materialized but lacks the mission dir (the coord-empty state), apply
       Option B: return the PRIMARY checkout surface. For a solo (no-lanes)
       coord mission (``MissionTopology.COORD``) this is the EXPECTED steady
       state pre-first-write, so the fallback is quiet — no warning (#2533 /
       WP08). For a mission WITH lanes (``MissionTopology.LANES_WITH_COORD``,
       lane worktrees were provisioned to write there) an empty coord root is
       genuinely unexpected, so the fallback still emits a single loud
       ``logging.WARNING`` (:data:`_COORD_EMPTY_FALLBACK_WARNING`) naming the
       stale-surface risk and both recovery paths (#1716 / FR-001 / FR-003).
       The coord-state decision routes through WP01's :func:`probe_coord_state`
       (adopted, not re-derived); the solo-vs-lanes split reuses the
       ``effective_topology`` already disposed above (no parallel derivation).
       The ``CoordState.DELETED`` case still hard-fails
       (:class:`CoordinationBranchDeleted`, #1848).

    ``for_write`` preserves coordination validation for placement callers. A
    completed mission's primary read authority does not grant write placement
    for artifact kinds excluded from post-consolidation writes (#4358).

    Raises FileNotFoundError when meta.json is absent.
    Raises ValueError when meta.json is malformed.
    Raises CoordinationBranchDeleted when the coord worktree is absent AND the
        declared coordination branch has been deleted from git (#1848 data-loss
        carve-out — never a silent fallback).
    Raises StatusReadPathNotFound when the coord-worktree mid8 cannot be derived
        from any declared source (fail closed — never fabricate a mid8).
