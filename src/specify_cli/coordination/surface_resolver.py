"""Canonical status-surface resolver for Spec Kitty missions.

This module is the **sole** canonical authority for coord-vs-primary
status-surface selection (FR-001 / FR-007). Every mission-surface read routes
through :func:`resolve_status_surface_with_anchor` — directly, or via the
blessed ``resolve_surface_dir_or_typed_error`` delegator (aggregate /
``mission_runtime``) — so no secondary fallback or parallel resolution
mechanism survives outside this seam. ``coordination/status_transition.py``'s
former path-shape topology predicates (the #1900 5th selection site) now
delegate to :func:`classify_worktree_topology` / :func:`is_registered_coord_worktree`
here; the C-002 topology-ratchet allowlist entry that reserved them is drained
(tests/architectural/test_topology_resolution_boundary.py). Any contributor
reaching for a parallel resolution path should treat this constraint as
load-bearing (NFR-003 compliance boundary).

The coord-empty case (a materialized-but-empty coordination worktree) is an
operator-decided **loud primary fallback** (Option B; FR-001 / FR-003 / #1716):
the resolver falls back to the primary checkout and proceeds. For a coord
mission WITH lanes (``MissionTopology.LANES_WITH_COORD`` — lane worktrees were
provisioned to write there), an empty coord root is genuinely unexpected, so
the fallback emits a single ``logging.WARNING``
(:data:`_COORD_EMPTY_FALLBACK_WARNING`) that names the stale-surface risk AND
both operator recovery paths — flatten (drop ``coordination_branch`` from
``meta.json``) OR run ``spec-kitty doctor workspaces --fix``. For a solo
coord mission with no lanes (``MissionTopology.COORD``), an empty coord root
is the EXPECTED steady state until the mission's first coordination-branch
write self-materializes it (#2533 / WP08 T029-T031): the fallback stays
quiet — no warning, no manual flatten prompted for a condition that is not an
error. It NEVER silently degrades for the genuinely unexpected case: the
warning makes that fallback observable so an operator or orchestrating agent
can intervene. The decision is recorded in
``docs/adr/3.x/2026-06-19-1-coord-empty-surface-fallback.md`` and bound
to this single resolver. (The sibling coord-*deleted* case stays a hard-fail —
:class:`CoordinationBranchDeleted`, #1848 — because a deleted branch carrying
unmerged status is data loss, not a degraded read.)

Coord-topology resolution happens **exactly once** (FR-036). The coord-aware
:func:`candidate_feature_dir_for_mission` resolver already returns the
coordination-worktree feature dir whenever that worktree is materialized on
disk; this module therefore never re-invokes that resolver on an
already-resolved root. The only remaining case it handles directly is the
transitional window where ``meta.json`` declares ``coordination_branch`` but
the coord worktree has not been materialized yet — there it composes the coord
path **once**, by hand, rather than resolving a second time. Re-running the
coord-aware resolver against a coord root nested
``.worktrees/<m>-coord/.worktrees/<m>-coord/…`` (the #1772 double-resolution
bug); building the path directly avoids that.

    fork from the primary branch and clobber committed coordination state.

    The probe scans the WHOLE coordination Mission-dir subtree of *coord_branch*

    logs a ``WARNING`` naming the failure, then returns ``True`` (treated as

    observable rather than indistinguishable from a quiet, correct refusal. The

       materialized, compose the coord path **directly** (one derivation, via

       (adopted, not re-derived); the solo-vs-lanes split reuses the
       ``effective_topology`` already disposed above (no parallel derivation).
       The ``CoordState.DELETED`` case still hard-fails
       (:class:`CoordinationBranchDeleted`, #1848).

    ``for_write`` preserves coordination validation for placement callers. A
    completed mission's primary read authority does not grant write placement
    for artifact kinds excluded from post-consolidation writes (#4358).
    ``for_write=True`` is **commit-ref oriented, not a write location**

    :func:`~mission_runtime.resolution.resolve_placement_only` (via

    Extracted verbatim from :func:`resolve_status_surface_with_anchor` (T006,
    campsite-clean WP01) — no new side effects (no git writes, no directory
    creation, no materialization); the warning call and its ``.parent.parent``
    derivation reproduce exactly. Widened (coord-artifact-single-home-01M3V4BE
    WP04, binding correction round 3 "D4 / naming fix") to take ``repo_root``
    and ``coord_branch`` — WP01 could not pre-add them here because ruff ARG
    would have flagged the then-unused parameters.

    Option B loud primary fallback (FR-001 / FR-003 / #1716): the coord worktree
    root is materialized but its mission dir is absent (coord-empty). Reading the
    primary checkout may expose a stale, split-brain status surface (#1589/#1821),
    so emit a single loud ``logging.WARNING`` naming the risk AND both recovery
    paths (flatten OR `spec-kitty doctor workspaces --fix`) — making the fallback
    observable so an operator/orchestrating agent can intervene — then return the
    PRIMARY surface and proceed.

    #2533: a solo (no-lanes) coord-topology mission whose coord worktree
    never received a write is an EXPECTED empty state, not a stale
    split-brain — routing it to PRIMARY is the correct, quiet outcome
    (WP08 T029). Only ``MissionTopology.LANES_WITH_COORD`` implies real
    lane worktrees were provisioned to write there; for THAT shape an
    empty coord root is genuinely unexpected and the loud warning's
    true-positive signal must survive (WP08 T031). ``effective_topology``
    is the SAME value already disposed by the caller (no re-derivation, no
    parallel ``pr_bound`` signal) — solo ``COORD`` is the only other
    coord-routing member (``_topology_uses_coord_surface`` gated this
    branch to exactly {COORD, LANES_WITH_COORD} already).

    **Post-fix loudness (WP04, research D4/US2.7/FR-003a).** After mission
    coord-artifact-single-home-01M3V4BE every COORD write seeds the
    coordination surface (WP06+), so a **post-fix** mission's EMPTY worktree
    (its coordination-branch history already carries the
    ``Spec-Kitty-Coordination-Seed: <mission_id>`` trailer, WP03's single
    discriminator, :func:`~specify_cli.coordination.coord_seed.
    coord_branch_is_post_fix`) signals a regression — the Mission dir was
    removed from an otherwise-seeded worktree — and now warns for **both**
    coordination topologies, not only ``LANES_WITH_COORD``. A pre-fix
    Mission (no trailer yet) keeps today's behaviour unchanged: quiet for
    solo ``COORD`` (#2533), loud for ``LANES_WITH_COORD``.

    **Dedup (binding correction round 3) — narrowed to avoid a regression.**
    This EMPTY branch is ALSO reachable from
    :func:`~mission_runtime.resolve_placement_only` /
    :meth:`~mission_runtime.resolution.PlacementSeam.write_target` (via
    ``_assemble_core_fragments(for_write=True)``), which pre-date this WP and
    are PINNED (``tests/mission_runtime/test_status_read_path_error_contract.py``)
    to already emit today's unconditional ``LANES_WITH_COORD`` warning on
    THAT path too — gating the warning itself on ``not for_write`` would
    silently remove that warning for every caller that has not migrated to
    :meth:`~mission_runtime.resolution.PlacementSeam.write_dir` yet (none
    have, as of this WP), a real regression, not a dedup. Only the NEW
    post-fix trailer probe (one extra subprocess, and the only thing that
    could newly warn a solo ``COORD`` write-side caller) is gated on
    ``not for_write``: :func:`~specify_cli.coordination.coord_seed.
    establish_coord_write_location` (reached ONLY through ``write_dir``, the
    one caller that actually performs a WRITE here) already emits its OWN
    post-fix warning, on its own logger, when it restores a post-fix
    surface — so a ``write_dir`` caller is never left silent, and a
    not-yet-migrated ``write_target`` caller keeps EXACTLY today's
    LANES_WITH_COORD-only behaviour, unchanged.
