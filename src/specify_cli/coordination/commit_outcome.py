"""Per-surface commit outcome contract (mission coord-artifact-single-home-01M3V4BE, WP05).

The single canonical home for the per-surface commit-outcome shape every
``commit_for_mission`` consumer renders through — ``contracts/commit-outcome.md``
(FR-006 / FR-007 / FR-007a / FR-007b / FR-005; SC-003). ``commit_router.py``
populates :class:`SurfaceOutcome` instances on ``CommitRouterResult.surfaces``;
this module owns the TYPES, the REASON CODES, and the ONE renderer / JSON
payload builder / exit-code helper every consumer shares (contract rule 6 —
"no consumer formats surface outcomes by hand").

Ownership direction (brownfield scout round 3, T024 CORRECTION): this module
must NOT import ``commit_router`` (that would cycle — ``commit_router`` imports
THIS module for the ``SurfaceOutcome`` / ``PathFate`` types it constructs).
Instead this module is the single owner of the status/reason string literals;
``commit_router.py`` and ``surface_authority.py`` both import them from here
rather than each declaring their own copy (Sonar S1192 — the literals were
previously duplicated across both modules).

No ``specify_cli.cli`` import (the layering guard, ``test_commit_router_layering.py``
forbids it transitively through ``commit_router``): this module never touches a
console; :func:`render_commit_outcome` only returns plain ``str`` lines, so any
stream-encoding concern (e.g. a cp1252 Windows console choking on ``✓``/``✗``) is
the caller's responsibility, not this pure function's.
