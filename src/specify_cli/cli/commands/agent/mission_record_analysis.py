"""Record-analysis command seam for ``agent mission`` (#2056 Seam A).

The lowest-risk command slice: the ``record-analysis`` command and its two
dedicated helpers, plus the small ``_git_dirty_paths`` git helper they depend
on. A one-way leaf that imports the Seam C/D surfaces (mission_parsing,
mission_feature_resolution) and lower layers only — never back into
``mission`` (INV-8). Heavyweight commit/SaaS imports stay function-local to
avoid import cycles (NFR-005).

The command function is defined here as a plain callable; ``mission.py``
registers it on its Typer ``app`` (``app.command(...)(record_analysis)``) so the
CLI surface is unchanged (WP01 golden harness is the regression net). Behavior
is preserved byte-for-byte from the pre-decomposition ``mission.py``.
