"""Pure decision cores + a minimal git port for ``implement.py`` (WP03 / #2173).

This module extracts the git-porcelain/diff family and the placement-resolution
family that used to live inline in ``cli/commands/implement.py`` into small,
independently testable functions. Any function that needs live git data takes
an injected :class:`GitPort` (T015 "git injected as a port" requirement) so
the decision/parsing logic itself can be exercised in unit tests without a
real repository and without mocking ``subprocess``.

:class:`_SubprocessGitPort` is the ONE git-subprocess I/O boundary in this
module -- a thin adapter, not decision logic. Every port-consuming function
below defaults its ``git`` parameter to :data:`DEFAULT_GIT_PORT` (an instance
of that adapter), so every existing call site in ``implement.py`` -- and every
external test that imports these names directly with their historical,
git-param-free signatures -- keeps working unchanged against real git.

``implement.py`` re-exports the public names from here via a bare import (not
added to its own ``__all__``); see the module docstring there for the shim
contract (T019 / FR-009).
