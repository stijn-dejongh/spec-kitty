"""Coordination + git-health cluster for ``doctor`` (WP07, #2059).

Extracts Cluster K out of ``doctor.py``: the git-version (RR-01) check, the
tracked-``.worktrees/`` hygiene check, the coordination-worktree health check,
and the lane sparse-checkout drift check. The ``_check_lane_sparse_checkout_drift``
CC19 monolith is decomposed into <=15-CC sub-helpers (per-lane scan + finding
assembly).

H2 / I-6 — CRITICAL: ``merge.path_is_under_worktrees`` is imported FUNCTION-LOCAL
inside :func:`_check_tracked_worktrees_content`. Hoisting it to module scope
reintroduces the ``doctor <-> merge`` module-load cycle. It must stay local.

Import discipline (one-way, I-2): imports shared infra from
:mod:`._doctor_shared`; never imports the CLI ``doctor`` module at module scope.

WP06 (coord-commit-integrity-01KY5JS8, FR-008/FR-009, Gap-1): adds the
coord-BRANCH-vs-``target_branch`` staleness detector
(:func:`_coord_branch_stale_vs_target_finding`), the ``--check-staleness``
doctor mode, and the minimized ``--fix`` fast-forward
(:func:`_apply_coord_staleness_fixes`). This is distinct from the existing
``_coord_worktree_stale_finding`` (worktree HEAD vs its OWN coord branch) —
Gap-1 is the residual case where the coord branch itself falls behind the
branch it publishes onto. ``--fix`` stays MINIMIZED (C-003): it performs ONLY
this fast-forward, and FAILS LOUD (unified diff, zero mutation) on anything
short of strict-ancestor + a clean coord worktree (C-005 warn-first).
:func:`check_and_warn_coord_staleness` is the public one-liner hook consumed
by ``agent/tasks_finalize.py`` (DIRECTIVE_024 declared out-of-map call — that
module is outside this WP's ``owned_files``).
