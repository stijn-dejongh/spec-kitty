"""Merge command implementation.

Lane worktrees are the only supported execution topology. ``spec-kitty merge``
always follows the same two-step flow, and the two steps are two *distinct*
"merge" operations (see the sense entries in ``docs/context/orchestration.md``):
1. Lane consolidation (``merge`` Sense 1, LOCAL): consolidate each lane branch
   into the mission branch — no remote push.
2. Branch integration / git merge (``merge`` Sense 2): integrate the mission
   branch into the target branch.
Neither step is publish-to-origin/main (``merge`` Sense 3): that operator-only
publish happens only under ``--push`` and is never implied by the command name.

Planning-artifact-only missions are the exception: their artifacts are already
committed to the target branch, so merge performs closeout bookkeeping directly
on that target branch without requiring a mission branch.

Recovery semantics (WP01 / 067):
- MergeState is created at merge start and updated after each WP mark-done.
- On interruption, rerunning ``merge`` detects the existing state and resumes.
- ``--resume`` explicitly triggers resume; ``--abort`` cleans up state and exits.
- ``cleanup_merge_workspace`` preserves state.json so recovery works.
- ``clear_state`` is called only after confirmed full completion.

# #2057 DECOMPOSITION SHIM (matches the #2056 / #1623 convention).
#
# This module is the thin Typer command-registration shim for ``spec-kitty
# merge``. The former ~3383-LOC / maxCC-102 god-module was decomposed into
# cohesive, independently-tested seams under ``specify_cli/merge/``:
#
#   _constants.py            shared literals / type aliases / logger
#   git_probes.py            branch/tree/porcelain git primitives (+ public
#                            ``path_is_under_worktrees``)
#   resolve.py               slug / merge-state / target-branch resolution
#   preflight.py             git / target / mission-branch / canonical-status /
#                            review-artifact / hollow-review preflights
#   push_preflight.py        publish-layer push/target-sync preflight (#1706)
#   forecast.py              ``--dry-run`` preview + JSON/human payload build
#   ordering.py              mission-number bake cluster (+ merge ordering)
#   done_bookkeeping.py      done/approved emission + done asserts + reconcile
#   bookkeeping_projection.py status-surface trust + snapshot/restore + projection
#   executor.py              ``_run_lane_based_merge[_locked]`` + the phase helpers
#
# RULES (do NOT regress):
#   * This shim owns ONLY the ``merge`` command, its dispatch helpers, and the
#     re-export ``__all__`` (kept byte-stable so the 3 src consumers +
#     ~41 importing test files need zero edits — INV-4 / FR-006).
#   * One-way imports: seams never import this shim (no cycles — C-006/INV-2).
#   * Extract new responsibilities into a seam; never grow this module.
