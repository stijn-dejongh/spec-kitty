"""Doctrine/profile health *render* helpers for ``spec-kitty doctor doctrine``.

Pure extraction (mission ``tooling-stability-guard-coherence-01KTRC04`` WP08,
issue #1623 / DIRECTIVE_013 / adversarial finding I-10): the doctrine- and
profile-health *rendering* helpers that grew on ``doctor.py`` during mission
``org-doctrine-profile-integrity-activation-closure-01KT1TV1`` belong beside the
single-source health model in :mod:`._doctrine_health`.  These helpers turn a
:class:`._doctrine_health.DoctrineHealthReport` (plus the registry pack entries
and selection block assembled by ``doctor.py``'s collectors) into operator
output — human Rich console lines and the ``--json`` payload.

This is a **pure move**: the bodies are verbatim relocations of the helpers that
previously lived in ``doctor.py`` (only the module docstring and the imports
differ).  The data *collectors* (``_collect_profile_health``,
``_attach_pack_health``, ``_build_pack_entries``, ``_collect_org_layer_data``,
``_collect_doctrine_collisions``, ``_build_selection_block``) and the
``doctrine`` command itself stay in ``doctor.py``; only the render-only surface
moved here.

The module-level :data:`console` is the shared singleton: ``doctor.py`` imports
it from here so the whole ``doctor`` command surface and these renderers write
through one :class:`rich.console.Console` instance.
