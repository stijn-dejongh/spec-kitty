"""Doctrine-health DATA COLLECTORS for the ``doctor doctrine`` command (WP03, #2059).

This module completes the doctrine-health seam that #1623 left behind. #1623
scoped its extraction to the RENDER layer only (``_profile_health_render``) and
left the collectors in ``doctor.py``. This module moves Cluster J — the data
collectors — beside the existing MODEL (:mod:`._doctrine_health`) and RENDER
(:mod:`._profile_health_render`) modules, finishing the MODEL/RENDER/COLLECT
triad.

Import discipline (one-way graph, I-2): collect → model / render / shared. This
module imports from :mod:`._doctrine_health` (MODEL types), from
:mod:`._profile_health_render` (the ``_SELECTION_KIND_PLURALS`` constant), and
from :mod:`._doctor_shared` if shared infra is needed. It must NEVER import
``doctor.py`` (the orchestrator re-exports FROM here).
