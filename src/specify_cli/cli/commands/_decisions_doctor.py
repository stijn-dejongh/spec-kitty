"""``doctor decisions`` sibling — event-log reconciler for the Decision Moment
index (T012, mission local-write-safety-01M2ZPZD WP03, FR-004/FR-005).

Per the doctor per-subcommand-module convention (``_mission_state_doctor.py``
/ ``_review_cycle_reconcile_doctor.py``, #4813 soft-gated extraction SHAPE):
the ``decisions`` ``@app.command`` shell in ``doctor.py`` stays a thin
delegator; all diagnose/repair logic lives here.

Diagnoses (default, read-only) or repairs (``--repair``) divergence between
``decisions/index.json`` and the authoritative ``status.events.jsonl`` event
log, via the SAME canonical ``event -> IndexEntry`` fold the forward write
path (``decisions/service.py``) shares
(:mod:`specify_cli.decisions.index_fold`) — see
``kitty-specs/local-write-safety-01M2ZPZD/contracts/decisions-doctor.md``
("Single fold, no second reducer"). ``--repair`` runs under the SAME sidecar
lock the write path uses (T010, I8), so a concurrent open/resolve cannot race
a repair.

Repair never invents an entry absent from the log, and never drops a
log-backed entry: :func:`_rebuild_index_from_log` rebuilds the ENTIRE index
from every ``decision_point_id`` group found in the log, via
:func:`~specify_cli.decisions.index_fold.fold_events` — nothing in this
module hand-interprets an opened/resolved payload.

Review-feedback-2 (cycle 2, operator-directed fold-in): two follow-ups on the
otherwise-approved substance above.

- **Fold A** — the log-derived fold cannot faithfully reconstruct a
  slot_key-origin decision (the wire only carries one collapsed ``step_id``
  field, an upstream ``spec_kitty_events`` schema gap this WP does not own —
  see :func:`_is_unrecoverable_slot_key_origin`). ``--repair`` now detects
  that case from the PRE-repair on-disk entry and refuses to rewrite its
  attribution rather than silently mis-attributing it, warning loudly
  instead (:func:`_emit_lossy_attribution_warning`).
- **Fold B** — :func:`_repair` re-reads the event log AND the current index
  itself, INSIDE the sidecar lock, rather than rebuilding from
  ``_diagnose``'s pre-lock snapshot — closing the window in which a
  concurrent open/resolve landing between the diagnose read and the lock
  acquisition would be silently dropped.

- **Fold C** (#470 dead-symbol gate + robustness) — :func:`fold_events`
  (:mod:`specify_cli.decisions.index_fold`) raises
  :class:`~specify_cli.decisions.index_fold.FoldError` when a decision's
  grouped event envelopes violate the fold's invariants (no
  ``DecisionPointOpened``, more than one ``DecisionPointOpened``/
  ``DecisionPointResolved``, or an unrecognized event type) — a malformed
  on-disk event log, not a programmer error. Before this fold-in nothing in
  this module caught it, so one malformed decision_id's event group crashed
  the WHOLE ``--repair``/diagnose run with an uncaught exception, including
  every OTHER decision that was folding cleanly. :func:`_rebuild_index_from_log`
  now catches ``FoldError`` per decision_id (mirroring Fold A's
  keep-pre-repair-entry-unchanged shape): it keeps the PRE-repair on-disk
  entry unchanged if one exists, drops the decision_id from the rebuilt
  index if it does not, and records the decision_id in the returned
  malformed-fold list either way so the caller can report the condition
  cleanly instead of the doctor crashing.

    concurrent open/resolve.

    Fold B (review-feedback-2, cycle 2): ``_diagnose``'s log/index reads run
    BEFORE this lock is acquired, so by the time this acquisition succeeds
    that snapshot may already be stale — a concurrent open/resolve landing
    in the window between the diagnose read and the lock acquisition would
    be silently dropped by a rebuild sourced from it. This function
    therefore re-reads BOTH the event log and the current index itself,
    INSIDE the lock, rather than accepting either as a pre-lock argument.

    ``events_dir`` (COORD) and ``ledger_dir`` (PRIMARY, #4966 AC-D2) are
    resolved separately by the caller; the lock is taken against
    ``ledger_dir`` — the SAME dir ``decisions/service.py`` locks against.

    Returns ``(lossy_ids, malformed_ids)``: the decision_ids
    :func:`_rebuild_index_from_log` refused to rewrite (Fold A) and the
    decision_ids whose event group raised ``FoldError`` (Fold C), so the
    caller can report both conditions loudly instead of crashing.
