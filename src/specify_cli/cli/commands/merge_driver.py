"""Hidden git merge-driver entrypoints for Spec Kitty repositories.

Seven custom drivers keep mission bookkeeping semantic under the mission→target
``git merge --squash`` in ``lanes/consolidation.py::_merge_branch_into`` (#4892 dropped
the old ``-X theirs``; ordinary source paths now fail closed on conflict). A
custom driver takes over conflict resolution on the paths it is registered for,
so target-newer canonical state is reconciled rather than clobbered or
hard-conflicting (#2709 / FR-003 / FR-004 / FR-008):

- ``merge-driver-event-log``         — ``status.events.jsonl`` union (append-only log).
- ``merge-driver-meta``              — ``meta.json`` field merge: acceptance/VCS keys
  target-authoritative (the accepted-newer ``ours`` side), ``acceptance_history``
  unioned, all other (planning) keys mission-authoritative (``theirs``; preserves
  the #1732 planning-artifact authority — mission keys win).
- ``merge-driver-traces``            — ``traces/*.md`` markdown union: order-preserving
  line-level dedup so both sides' sections survive without duplication.
- ``merge-driver-acceptance-matrix`` — ``acceptance-matrix.json`` row-aware,
  base-aware (3-way) merge over ``criteria``/``negative_invariants``, keyed by
  ``criterion_id``/``invariant_id`` (FR-008 / see ``contracts/merge-driver-
  algorithm.md``).
- ``merge-driver-issue-matrix``      — ``issue-matrix.json`` row-aware,
  base-aware (3-way) merge over ``rows``, keyed by canonicalized ``issue_ref``.
- ``merge-driver-review-cycle``      — ``tasks/<wp>/review-cycle-*.md``
  best-effort, non-aborting reconciliation of a two-verdict collision (see
  ``specify_cli.consolidation.drivers.run_review_cycle_driver``'s docstring for the
  full history).
- ``merge-driver-decision-index``    — ``decisions/index.json`` union keyed by
  ``decision_id``, terminal-beats-open fold precedence (FR-009b / see
  ``specify_cli.consolidation.drivers.run_decision_index_driver``'s docstring).

Git invokes a driver with ``%O %A %B`` = base / ours / theirs and expects the
merged result written to the ``ours`` (``%A``) path with exit 0. Under the squash
integration ``ours`` is the target checkout (e.g. ``main``) and ``theirs`` is the
mission branch.

**Placement (#5119 / FR-002/FR-003/C-001).** This module is a THIN adapter
over ``specify_cli.consolidation.drivers`` — the single owner of every driver's
file-level body, reconciliation logic, and serialization (moved there so the
in-process driver replay, ``consolidation/git_probes.py``, executes the exact SAME
body a real ``git merge --squash`` subprocess invocation would). Every
function here keeps its pre-move name, parameters, and ``typer.Argument``
declarations (the registrar at ``cli/commands/__init__.py:341
_register_merge_driver`` binds them by attribute; C-001 holds — no
user-facing behavior, argument order, or exit code changed) and does nothing
but call its body and translate the body's
:class:`~specify_cli.consolidation.drivers.MergeDriverError` /
:class:`~specify_cli.consolidation.drivers.MergeDriverOutcome` into
``typer.echo``/``typer.Exit``.

    ``review_result`` event slot is the sole verdict authority, so refusing
    the merge over it is no longer justified.

    Identical content on both sides (byte-for-byte) is the trivial fast path:
    resolves cleanly, exit 0, never reported as a conflict. Otherwise, both
    raw documents are embedded verbatim inside standard git-style conflict
    markers (never blended field-by-field -- a review verdict has no safely
    mergeable sub-fields the way a JSON matrix row does) and the driver
    exits 0, so ``git merge --squash`` treats the path as resolved
    and the squash proceeds.
