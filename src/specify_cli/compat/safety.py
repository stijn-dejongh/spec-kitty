# =============================================================================
# SAFETY REGISTRY — CLI command classification for schema-mismatch gate
#
# If you add a new CLI command, register it here (in SAFETY_REGISTRY) or it
# will be treated as UNSAFE under schema mismatch.
#
# Keys are command_path tuples, e.g. ("upgrade",) or ("agent", "mission",
# "branch-context").  A value of None means "always safe".  A callable value
# (SafetyPredicate) is consulted at classify() time; any exception it raises
# falls back to UNSAFE (fail-closed defensive behaviour).
# =============================================================================
"""Safety classification for CLI invocations under schema-mismatch conditions.

Design note — avoiding import cycles
--------------------------------------
``classify()`` needs to inspect an ``Invocation`` object, but the canonical
``Invocation`` dataclass lives in the planner package which has not been
implemented yet (later WP).  To avoid a forward-import cycle we define a
local ``Protocol`` describing only the two fields we actually read
(``command_path`` and ``raw_args``).  Any object that satisfies the protocol
— including ``types.SimpleNamespace`` in tests and the real ``Invocation``
at runtime — will work correctly.

Thread-safety note
------------------
``SAFETY_REGISTRY`` is a plain ``dict``.  CPython's GIL guarantees that
individual ``dict`` read/write operations are atomic, so concurrent calls to
``classify()`` and ``register_safety()`` from different threads are safe
without additional locking.  This is consistent with standard CPython dict
usage patterns.
