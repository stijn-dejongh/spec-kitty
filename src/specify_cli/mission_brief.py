"""Mission brief file management for intake flows.

Provides two local artefacts written by ``spec-kitty intake``:

* ``.kittify/mission-brief.md``  — plan document with provenance header for the LLM
* ``.kittify/brief-source.yaml`` — SHA-256 fingerprint + metadata for traceability

Neither file should be committed to version control; both are gitignored.

Security-critical helpers (provenance escaping, atomic writes) live in the
``specify_cli.intake`` package; this module is the operator-facing surface
that composes them.

    renames ``source.yaml`` first, then ``brief.md`` as the commit
    marker. If a kill happens between the two renames, ``source.yaml``

    that orphan state as "no brief" so callers see the same surface as
