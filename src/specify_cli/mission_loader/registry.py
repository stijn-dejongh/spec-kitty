"""In-memory runtime contract registry (R-004, FR-006, FR-008).

Provides a per-process shadow that overlays the on-disk
:class:`MissionStepContractRepository` for the lifetime of a custom
mission run. Inside the
:func:`registered_runtime_contracts` ``with`` block, contract lookups
resolve against the shadow first and fall through to the on-disk
repository only when the shadow does not contain the id. Outside the
``with`` block the shadow is empty and every lookup goes straight to
the repository.

The registry is intentionally simple:

* It is a process-local singleton; the CLI is single-threaded so we do
  not introduce locking. If the runtime ever grows a thread/async
  worker pool, this module should grow a lock at the same time.
* The on-disk repository is never mutated. Synthesized contracts live
  only in memory and disappear when the outermost ``with`` block exits.
* Nested ``with`` blocks compose via a stack-of-snapshots model: each
  ``__enter__`` snapshots the current shadow before registering its
  contracts, and ``__exit__`` restores that snapshot. So an inner block
  that registers ``B`` over an outer block that registered ``A`` sees
  both ``A`` and ``B`` while inside; on inner exit only ``B`` is
  removed and ``A`` remains visible until the outer block exits.

WP03 only provides the façade :func:`lookup_contract`. WP04 owns the
wiring change that routes
:class:`~specify_cli.mission_step_contracts.executor.StepContractExecutor`
through this façade. Until WP04 lands, the executor still calls
``repository.get(...)`` directly and the shadow is unused at runtime.
