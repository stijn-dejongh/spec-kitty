"""Diff-aware review compliance for bulk-edit occurrence maps.

Implements FR-007 and FR-008: when a mission is marked ``change_mode: bulk_edit``
and a work package reaches review, the review gate inspects the WP's diff and
rejects it when

  * any changed file maps (by path heuristic) to a category whose action is
    ``do_not_change``, unless an explicit exception grants a different action
    for that file, **or**

  * any changed file cannot be classified against the occurrence map's
    categories at all (unclassified occurrence surface touched).

Classification is deliberately path-based, not AST-based. Spec constraint
C-001 excludes language-aware occurrence classification. Path heuristics
are imperfect — a ``.py`` file can carry code symbols, import paths, path
literals, and log labels all at once — so we classify each file to a single
primary category based on its filesystem location and file extension. This
is sufficient to catch the most common silent-breakage class: whole-file
modifications inside a surface marked ``do_not_change`` (serialized-key
YAMLs, CLI command modules, test fixtures, user-facing docs, etc.).
