        "no contribution from that pack" instead of letting it crash
        composition.

        Mirrors ``charter.action_doctrine_bundle._resolve_action_bundle``'s
        established handling of the same ``load_validated_graph(...,
        org_roots=...)`` call: a configured org pack whose on-disk DRG layout
        does not conform to ``load_graph_or_dir`` (no ``graph.yaml``/
        ``*.graph.yaml`` directly at its root -- this repo's own
        ``packs/internal`` is exactly this shape) must not turn every
        composition dispatch in the consuming project into a hard block.
        Before org-tier resolution was wired into this executor, such a
        misconfigured-but-registered pack was simply never exercised on this
        path, so its layout mismatch was inert; degrading here restores that
        "an optional tier being broken doesn't stop dispatch" behaviour
        without silencing the problem (D-005: WARNING, never silent --
        matches ``resolve_org_dirs``'s per-dropped-root warning and
        ``_resolve_expected_artifacts_slot``'s malformed-manifest warning,
        the same treatment already applied elsewhere in this mission for the
        same class of problem).

        #3525 Fold B — per-root degrade: each root in *org_roots* is
        independently probed (via ``load_graph_or_dir``, the same loader
        ``load_validated_graph`` uses internally for each root) BEFORE the
        chain-wide merge, so a malformed pack #2 drops ONLY pack #2 (one
        WARNING) while pack #1 -- and every other healthy root -- still
        contributes. This replaces the pre-fix all-or-nothing degrade, which
        collapsed the ENTIRE org tier the moment any single configured root
        failed to load.

        This degrade is deliberately narrow: when *org_roots* is empty (no
        org pack configured, or none exists on disk), any ``DRGLoadError``
        raised by the single ``load_validated_graph(repo_root, org_roots=[])``
        call below is a **built-in or project** layer failure and is left to
        propagate unchanged -- the no-org-pack path stays byte-identical to
        before this mission (no per-root probing runs at all). NFR-006's
        fail-closed posture for doctrine *content* correctness is untouched:
        a broken built-in graph, or a broken project overlay, still fails the
        dispatch outright. Only the optional org tier degrades, and only for
        the specific root(s) that actually failed to load.

        Do NOT drop this pre-probe on the assumption ``load_validated_graph``
        now covers it. As of PR #3534's landing that function skips a
        *graphless* root internally (a root with no root-level ``*.graph.yaml``
        -- it warns and contributes nothing), so for that specific shape this
        probe is redundant. But this probe additionally degrades a *malformed*
        root (a present-but-invalid root-level ``*.graph.yaml``), which
        ``load_validated_graph`` deliberately still lets fail loud. Removing it
        would reopen the malformed-content crash on this dispatch path.
