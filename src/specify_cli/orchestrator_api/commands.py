"""Machine-contract API commands for external orchestrators.

All commands emit a single JSON object to stdout via the canonical envelope.
Non-zero exit on any failure. Output is always JSON (no prose mode).

    The orchestrator-api contract requires *every* stdout emission to be a
    single JSON envelope, including parser-level failures (missing required
    args, unknown options, etc.).  Three overrides cooperate to cover every
    dispatch path:

    ``make_context(info_name, args, parent, **extra)``
        Catches errors during *group-level argument parsing* when nested.
        When the parent group calls ``make_context()`` on this sub-group
        (e.g. ``orchestrator-api --bogus``), the error would otherwise
        propagate to the parent's ``BannerGroup``.  This is the outermost
        catch for the nested path.

    ``invoke(ctx)``
        Catches errors during *subcommand dispatch*.  When this group is
        registered as a sub-group of the root CLI via ``add_typer()``, Click
        dispatches through ``invoke()``, not ``main()``.  Without this
        override the root ``BannerGroup`` would format the error as prose.

    ``main(*args, **kwargs)``
        Catches errors during *direct invocation* and group-level argument
        parsing (e.g. ``orchestrator-api --unknown-flag``).  Uses
        ``standalone_mode=False`` so ``click.UsageError`` propagates as an
        exception rather than being printed as plain text.

    Interaction: when both paths are active (direct invocation), a subcommand
    error is caught by ``invoke()`` first, which calls ``ctx.exit(2)``
    (raising ``SystemExit(2)``).  ``main()`` passes ``SystemExit`` through
    via ``except SystemExit: raise``, so no double emission occurs.

    ``_execute_lane_merge`` is a genuine SECOND deletion implementation (not a

    requires it to route through the same
    :func:`~specify_cli.core.paths.resolve_merge_retention` authority rather
    than deleting unconditionally. This mirrors the executor's topology-aware
    coupling **GATE** (#3131 T008 / INV-2): for a coord-topology mission (its
    primary meta.json carries a ``coordination_branch`` key) the
    mission/coordination branch is only deletable when BOTH ``delete_branch``
    and ``remove_worktree`` resolve True (``teardown_coordination``); for a
    non-coord mission it stays keyed to ``delete_branch`` alone. This guarantees
    a **retaining** coord mission's branch is never deleted here (NFR-003).

    Scope note: only the deletion GATE mirrors the executor. The orchestrator
    does NOT perform the executor's full coordination-triple teardown
    (``_teardown_coordination_triple``: coord-marker flatten + coord-worktree
    removal) — it only deletes the mission branch. A NON-retaining coord mission
    merged through orchestrator-api therefore leaves the ``coordination_branch``
    marker/worktree un-torn-down (a pre-existing orchestrator-api limitation,
    tracked separately, NOT introduced by #3131). Full coord teardown is the
    executor/CLI ``spec-kitty consolidate`` path's responsibility.

# Command: answer-decision (WP08, FR-013, Mechanism B, full event/lifecycle
# parity)
#
# Resolves a ``spec-kitty next`` control-loop ``decision_required`` moment (a
# blocking ``AuditStep`` checkpoint OR a ``PromptStep`` with an unmet
# ``requires_inputs`` entry) -- the run-snapshot's ``pending_decisions`` map
# (``_internal_runtime.engine._read_snapshot``), distinct from the
# ``decisions/index.json`` ledger the four verbs above operate on (Mechanism
# A, spec Clarification 3). Matches exactly what the real CLI invocation
# ``spec-kitty next --answer <value> --decision-id <id> --agent <name>
# --result <success|failed|blocked>`` does in one pass (``next_cmd.py:
# 213-269``), never just the two engine calls:
#
#   1. ``runtime_bridge.answer_decision_via_runtime`` persists the answer
#      against the (auto-resolved or explicit) ``decision_id``.
#   2. ``pair_previous_lifecycle_record`` pairs the previous issuance's
#      ``started`` lifecycle record BEFORE the DAG advances.
#   3. ``decide_next`` (the ENGINE call, ``runtime.next.decision``, NOT part
#      of WP02's seam) advances the DAG using THIS call's own ``--result``.
#   4. ``emit_mission_next_invoked`` appends a ``MissionNextInvoked`` entry
#      to the mission event log.
#   5. ``write_issuance_lifecycle_record`` writes a new issuance ``started``
#      record. Called unconditionally, exactly like the host CLI -- the
#      function itself self-no-ops when the resulting ``decision.kind`` is
#      not ``"step"``, so the predicate lives in the seam, not in this caller.
#
# Per operator ruling SPEC-FRESH2-001 (``kitty-specs/design-phase-
# orchestrator-api-01M1HE6M/reviews/spec.ruling.md``), steps 2/4/5 are
# REQUIRED, reached EXCLUSIVELY through WP02's extracted seam
# (``runtime.next.next_invocation_lifecycle``) -- never inlined, never
# reimplemented here. A verb performing only steps 1+3 (the two engine
# calls) is precisely the silent-success regression the ruling exists to
# prevent (SC-007/SC-008).
#
# Response shape: ``data`` is ``Decision.to_dict()`` from step 3 (byte-
# identical, field-for-field, to ``next --answer ... --json``) PLUS one
# sibling field, ``answered_decision_id`` (the ``decision_id`` persisted by
# step 1) -- ``answer-decision``'s own self-documenting name for the CLI's
# terser ``answered`` key. ``data`` carries NO ``answer`` key: the CLI's
# second extra key (the echoed submitted answer, the ``d["answer"] = answer``
# assignment inside ``next_cmd.py``'s ``_print_decision``) is intentionally
# OMITTED per SPEC-FRESH2-002's resolution -- the host already possesses the
# value it submitted in its own request.
#
# FR-012 does NOT apply here (spec Acceptance Scenario 6): this mechanism
# operates on the run-snapshot, not ``decisions/index.json`` -- a mission
# whose current phase has no ``OriginFlow`` member (``tasks``, ``analyze``)
# can still have a pending ``decision_required`` moment, and this verb
# resolves it normally. Do NOT apply the ``INVALID_ORIGIN_FLOW`` guard here.

def _tasks_are_finalized(mission_dir: Path) -> bool:
    """True once ``finalize-tasks`` has bootstrapped canonical status for at
    least one WP -- the SAME signal ``bootstrap_canonical_state``
    (``status/bootstrap.py``) writes, and the SAME reduction ``list-ready``
    already performs via ``reduce(read_events(mission_dir))`` (T029: reuse
    finalize-tasks's own signal, not a new heuristic). A ``tasks/`` directory
    merely populated by an earlier tasks-outline/tasks-packages pass does
    NOT set this -- only finalize-tasks's own bootstrap write does (verified
    against ``status/bootstrap.py``: ``bootstrap_canonical_state`` is called
    exclusively from the finalize-tasks command family, never from the
    outline/packages phases).

    Torn/truncated read handling (ledger SK-131, WP06-001 review finding):
    two DISTINCT corruption shapes, two distinct defenses --

    1. A genuinely torn line (an unlocked-writer race landing mid-read;
       historically -- as of 2026-08 -- only 2 of 6 ``status.events.jsonl``
       writers took the mission status lock; WP01 of
       fsm-write-path-integrity-01M1TZV6 serialized all seven writer
       families, see that mission's ``design-notes/WP01-lock-rules.md``)
       breaks JSON parsing itself: ``read_events`` raises
       ``StoreError`` on a malformed JSON line or invalid event structure.
       This function does NOT catch that exception -- it propagates to
       ``design_status``, which turns it into a structured
       ``DESIGN_STATUS_EVENT_LOG_UNREADABLE`` failure envelope instead of
       guessing.
    2. A rollback-truncated log (``coordination/transaction.py``'s
       ``_rollback``: ``fh.truncate(self._pre_emit_size)``, a byte offset
       captured BEFORE the append began) does NOT break JSON parsing --
       the file is append-only, so truncating to a pre-append offset
       always lands on a line boundary and every remaining line is still
       valid JSON. ``StoreError`` never fires for this shape, so (1)'s
       defense does not catch it: silently reducing the truncated log
       would return a plausible-but-wrong ``current_phase``/
       ``next_action`` snapshot, exactly the silent-success failure class
       this repo names as dominant (live-reproduced: dropping a real
       tasks-finalized mission's trailing bootstrap event line whole
       returned ``current_phase: "plan"`` with no error).

       Defense: a structural drift check against ``status.json`` --
       finalize-tasks's own ``bootstrap_canonical_state`` already
       materializes it (``status/bootstrap.py``) as a persisted,
       INDEPENDENT record of "these WP ids are known", written via
       atomic tmp-then-rename (``status/reducer.py::materialize``), so it
       cannot itself be torn. If the persisted ``work_packages`` set
       names a WP id the FRESH event-log reduction no longer contains,
       the event log lost information relative to the last durable
       materialization -- the SAME ``SNAPSHOT_DRIFT`` concept
       ``audit/classifiers/status_json.py`` already names for
       ``doctor mission-state --fix`` (issue #1782), reused here for this
       read path rather than inventing a parallel one. That drift is
       surfaced as ``StoreError`` so it flows through the SAME
       ``DESIGN_STATUS_EVENT_LOG_UNREADABLE`` handling as (1) -- one
       failure code for "the log cannot be trusted", regardless of which
       of the two shapes broke it.

       This does not require modeling ``_rollback`` exactly: its own
       truncate-then-restore-status.json sequence is two independently
       ``try/except OSError``-guarded steps (transaction.py:922-971), not
       one atomic operation, so a crash or I/O failure between them
       leaves precisely this asymmetric state on disk -- truncated events,
       stale-but-larger status.json -- on the real rollback path itself,
       not only via the live reproduction's direct file edit.

    Inode replacement (adjacent hazard, examined): CANNOT occur for
    ``status.events.jsonl`` specifically, because every writer mutates the
    file'S CONTENT in place through the SAME inode -- ``append_event``
    opens in ``"a"`` mode, ``_rollback`` opens in ``"ab"`` mode and
    truncates -- neither ever ``os.replace()``s a new inode over this
    path (unlike ``status.json``/``decisions/index.json``, which DO use
    tmp-then-rename, and are safe for the opposite reason: a reader who
    already holds an fd open before a rename keeps reading the old
    inode's complete content; a reader who opens after gets the fully-new
    inode's complete content -- either way, no torn/mixed read is
    possible via rename). No reader here can observe a page composed of
    two different inodes' bytes, because only one inode ever exists for
    this file.
