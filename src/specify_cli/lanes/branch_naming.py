"""Branch naming conventions for mission and lane branches.

Branch name grammar (two forms, both accepted by parse_mission_slug_from_branch):

  Legacy form (pre-WP02):
    kitty/mission-<NNN>-<slug>[-lane-<id>]
    where <NNN> is a 3-digit zero-padded numeric prefix

  New form (WP02+, FR-032, FR-033):
    kitty/mission-<human-slug>-<mid8>[-lane-<id>]
    where <human-slug> is the mission slug with any leading NNN- prefix stripped,
    and <mid8> is the first 8 characters of the mission's ULID.

Example for this mission:
  083-mission-id-canonical-identity-migration with ULID 01KNXQS9ATWWFXS3K5ZJ9E5008
  -> human-slug: mission-id-canonical-identity-migration
  -> mid8: 01KNXQS9
  -> branch: kitty/mission-mission-id-canonical-identity-migration-01KNXQS9-lane-a

Rationale: pre-merge branches must not carry dead numbering semantics, because
there is no mission_number until merge time (FR-044). The mid8 token ensures
two concurrent missions with identical human slugs produce distinct branch names
(FR-032), eliminating the partition-unsafe collision that led to the 080-* triple.

Both forms are accepted at read time so existing worktrees keep working (FR-052).
