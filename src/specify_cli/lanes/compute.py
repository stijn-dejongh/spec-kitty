"""Lane computation algorithm.

Groups work packages into execution lanes using a union-find structure.
Two WPs are placed in the same lane when:

1. They have overlapping owned_files globs (write-scope conflict).
2. They share predicted surface tags and ownership is not provably disjoint.

Dependency edges do not collapse lanes by themselves. They are preserved as
lane-level dependencies so disjoint upstream workstreams can run in parallel and
fan-in WPs become the synchronization point.
