"""Unified ``pack-manifest`` schema, reader, and derived per-kind counts.

This module defines the **single canonical** pack-metadata manifest schema that
replaces the two divergent formats that shipped previously (WP01 / IC-01):

* per-kind ``artifact_counts`` for org / fetched packs
  (``specify_cli.doctrine.snapshot.write_pack_manifest``), and
* the enumerated ``artifacts[]`` list of the charter bundle
  (``charter.synthesizer.manifest.SynthesisManifest``).

The enumerated shape is promoted to the canonical ``constituents[]`` inventory.
A charter pack additionally carries a :class:`CharterProfile` block preserving
the **entire** charter-only field-set of ``SynthesisManifest`` so no working
field is dropped during absorption (PP-M2).

Design references:
* ADR ``docs/adr/3.x/2026-08-16-1-pack-metadata-manifest-unification.md``
* ``kitty-specs/pack-metadata-manifest-unification-01M052PT/data-model.md``

Hashing is delegated to the **single** canonical manifest hasher
(:func:`charter.synthesizer.manifest.hash_manifest_payload`) — this module
never introduces a second SHA-256 implementation (RR-SF2 / T005). The
``generated_at`` / ``generated_by`` provenance fields are excluded from both
the ``manifest_hash`` and the byte-diff assertion so re-generating an unchanged
pack is byte-identical (NFR-003).
