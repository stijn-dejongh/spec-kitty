"""Pack lineage resolution: a data-only adapter over ``org_extends`` (FR-006, FR-007).

This module resolves two `id`-keyed pack-lineage edges introduced by the
pack-metadata manifest unification:

* ``parent_pack`` — a pack's parent, by ``pack_id`` (see
  ``data-model.md``'s ``PackDescriptor.parent_pack``).
* ``accompanies_doctrine_pack`` — a charter pack's pack-level binding to its
  accompanying doctrine pack, by ``pack_id``.

C-002 / NFR-001 (no parallel resolver)
---------------------------------------
``charter.org_extends.resolve_extends_order`` is the **single** canonical
resolver for lineage-chain topology (cycle detection, missing-base
detection, base-first ordering). The live ``extends:`` field feeds it a
**name-keyed** edge map today (``org_charter.py:517,525``). This module does
**not** introduce a second walker: :func:`resolve_pack_lineage_order` is a
data-only ``pack_id -> resolvable key`` adapter that builds a name-keyed
edge map and delegates the entire walk — including cycle and missing-base
detection — to :func:`charter.org_extends.resolve_extends_order`. No
traversal, recursion, or graph algorithm of its own lives in this module.

Lineage authority (two-key period, IC-05/PP-M1): the live ``extends:``
(name-keyed) map remains the single *live* resolution authority. This
adapter lets ``parent_pack`` (id-keyed) be resolved through the same
canonical resolver without retiring ``extends:`` — full migration to
``parent_pack`` as the sole edge source is deferred until ``pack_id``
backfill is universal.

Decoupling note (lane independence)
------------------------------------
This module operates purely on plain edge data handed in by the caller
(``Mapping[str, str | None]`` and friends) — it does **not** import
``pack_descriptor`` or ``pack_manifest`` types from sibling work packages.
Real callers (a future integration WP) will project a ``PackDescriptor``
collection down to these plain mappings before calling in.
