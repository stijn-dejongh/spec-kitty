"""The one editable presentation of the project-egress refusal policy (#3110).

This module is owned by **neither transport**. Before it existed the same policy
was written twice — once for the tracker SaaS transport (#3030 FR-029) and once
for the widen-mode SaaS client (#3030 FR-030) — as two near-identical modules
that a future editor could change independently. FR-008 requires **exactly one
editable presentation**, and this is it: one sentence template shared by the
three refusal-member verdict branches (split from a former single ``DENIED``
by the egress-single-authority mission), two further verdict branches for the
undetermined causes, one ``None`` guard and one import-failure degradation.

**Each transport passes its own identifier-set fragment as an argument.** The two
sets are asymmetric on purpose: the tracker carries no ``decision_id`` and the
SaaS client carries no ``project_slug`` or issue titles, so a single string
naming the union would tell a tracker operator that a decision id was at stake.
The fragments are *arguments*, not second presentations — a "consolidation" that
left two templates and merely parameterised them would not satisfy FR-008.
Consolidating changed **no operator-visible text**: both refusal strings render
byte-for-byte as they did before.

Why this module asks ``invocation.adapters.resolve_egress_consent`` rather than
resolving consent itself — **FR-012**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**FR-012 is High-impact and deliberately has no success criterion, so this
paragraph is the only thing standing between a future editor and a second
consent chain. It is written down here because nothing else would catch its
loss.**

C-003: project consent is represented **once**, and this module **must never
re-derive the checkout to project to consent chain locally**. The single
derivation lives in ``sync/__init__.py``'s ``_egress_consent_resolver``, which
reads the checkout's identity through
``routing.resolve_checkout_sync_routing_readonly`` and then asks
``sync.consent.consented_project_uuids`` — the same funnel the drain
(``delivery/selection.py``), the emitter, the daemon and ``local_commit`` all
walk, over the one declared precedence chain (project-local, machine index,
env). Re-deriving it here would be a second expression of one invariant, free to
drift, which is the defect class this mission keeps re-finding.

The seam is registered by ``sync`` into the CORE registry slot in
``invocation/adapters.py``, so reaching it costs one import and no new chain.
:class:`~specify_cli.invocation.adapters.EgressConsent` already carries the
fail-closed vocabulary this gate needs: **only** ``GRANTED`` permits egress, and
both undetermined causes (``NO_RESOLVER``, ``UNANSWERABLE``) refuse while staying
distinguishable for diagnosis.

Note the layering rule did **not** force this route.
``tests/architectural/test_integration_boundary.py`` forbids the CORE set
(``core/``, ``status/``, ``readiness/``, ``invocation/``) from importing the
INTEGRATION set with an allowlist ratcheted at zero. This module is classified
INTEGRATION (C-005, asserted by SC-025), so it may reach ``specify_cli.sync``.
The registry route is chosen on the single-chain ground above, not because a
gate demanded it.

What a refusal is **not** allowed to be
---------------------------------------

Not ``is_saas_sync_enabled()``. That flag is machine-global *arming*, which the
spec states is never a grant and which is the 2026-07-27 incident's own
mechanism — one exported ``SPEC_KITTY_ENABLE_SAAS_SYNC`` carried five
never-opted-in projects along with the intended one. Not the team scope, not the
current working directory, and not "we have a token". Only the project that owns
the data can consent for it.

Not a silent proceed when the project cannot be determined, either. An
unresolvable project is a **refusal** (FR-003 / NFR-001): inability to determine
consent is never consent. That same defect was found independently in four
places, most recently as ``if sync_enabled is False`` where the resolver returned
``None`` for two unrelated causes.

The attribution precondition — stated, because it is load-bearing
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The gate is handed a **checkout root**, and the funnel resolves it to that
checkout's ``project.uuid`` before asking consent. So consent is answered
per-*uuid*, not per-path — the root is an input to the resolution, not a
substitute for it. What the root *does* decide is **whose** consent gets asked,
and that is a real precondition:

    **Every construction site must pass the root of the project that owns the
    record the request will carry.**

If it ever passes some other root, the gate answers correctly for the wrong
project — which is this mission's entire bug class (cwd, ``repo_root``,
machine-global arming, daemon scope and a checkout-level grant were each a place
where consent was answered by *where the code was standing* rather than *whose
data was moving*). It is written down here rather than left implicit because an
unstated locality argument reads as obviously fine until someone adds the caller
that breaks it, and nothing tells them they broke it.

Two safety nets stand behind the precondition, and neither replaces it: a root
that is not a project root at all resolves to no uuid and therefore **denies**,
and a checkout that declares a *different* uuid than the one being asked about is
ignored by ``consent.py``'s level-1 vote. What neither net catches is the case
this precondition exists for: a *valid* root for the *wrong* project.

Tracker transport — the three construction sites that exist today
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. :func:`~specify_cli.tracker.origin.bind_mission_origin` — **derived from the
   data, not from locality.** ``_resolve_repo_root(feature_dir)`` walks *up* from
   the very directory whose ``meta.json`` supplies the ``mission_id`` and
   ``mission_slug`` being sent. The **non-interactive** creation path closes the
   loop: ``core/mission_creation.py`` builds ``feature_dir = resolved_root /
   kitty-specs / <slug>`` and passes both, ``origin_consumer`` reads the issue
   ``title`` from ``resolved_root/.kittify/pending-origin.yaml``, and walking back
   up from ``feature_dir`` returns ``resolved_root``. Every field in the payload
   originates under the root the client is attributed to. This holds even when
   ``create_mission_core`` is given an explicit ``repo_root`` that differs from
   the cwd, because the dossier, the meta and the pending origin all live under
   *that* root — so a cwd/owner divergence cannot arise here. **This site fires
   during mission creation with no operator action required**, which is why it is
   listed first.
2. :class:`~specify_cli.tracker.saas_service.SaaSTrackerService` — an
   operator-invoked command's own checkout (``require_repo_root()`` ->
   ``locate_project_root(Path.cwd())``). A locality argument, in its benign form:
   the routing keys (``project_slug`` / ``binding_ref``) and the pushed items are
   read from *that same* root's config and store, so the subject of the command
   genuinely is the checkout the operator is standing in. Same ground on which the
   egress inventory rules ``cli/commands/sync.py:1107,1204`` correct rather than
   defective.
3. :func:`~specify_cli.tracker.origin.search_origin_candidates` — takes the root
   from its caller and has **no production caller today**. Whoever wires one owes
   this precondition.

What would falsify the tracker enumeration — check these before adding a caller:

* A **daemon, sweep or batch** that iterates projects: constructing one client
  and reusing it across projects, or building it from the sweep's own checkout
  while the payload comes from a different project's dossier, breaks the
  invariant without changing a line in this module. Such a caller must construct
  a client per project, from that project's root.
* Passing a ``feature_dir`` that is **not** under the ``repo_root`` whose
  ``pending-origin.yaml`` supplied the issue title — the two halves of the payload
  would then belong to different projects. Today ``mission_creation`` derives both
  from one root, so it cannot happen.
* Resolving the root from ``Path.cwd()`` at a call site whose data came from
  somewhere else.

Widen-mode SaaS client — the four construction sites that exist today
----------------------------------------------------------------------

All four reach the client through
:meth:`~specify_cli.saas_client.client.SaasClient.from_env`. What leaks on this
transport is subtler than a payload and no less disclosing: four of the five
endpoints are GETs that carry ``mission_id`` **in the URL path**, documented as
"ULID **or** slug" — and a mission slug is a client engagement name. A request
line is not a safer place to put one than a request body.

1. ``cli/commands/charter/interview.py``, 2. ``missions/plan/plan_interview.py``,
3. ``missions/plan/specify_interview.py`` — the interview's own ``repo_root``, and
   the data is read back from that same root: ``mission_id`` comes from
   ``_get_mission_id(repo_root, mission_slug)`` (i.e. ``kitty-specs/<slug>/meta.json``
   under that root) and the discussion ``decision_id``\\ s come from
   ``WidenPendingStore(repo_root, mission_slug)``. Owner and root agree by
   derivation.
4. ``cli/commands/decision.py`` (``spec-kitty decision widen``) — **the weakest of
   the four, and the only one whose subject is not derived from its root.** The
   root is ``locate_project_root() or Path.cwd()`` while ``decision_id`` is an
   operator-supplied CLI argument, so an operator can name a decision belonging to
   a different project than the checkout they are standing in, and consent is then
   answered for the checkout rather than for the decision's owner.

   **The argument that used to bound this entry was measured false and has been
   removed.** It claimed the exposure was benign because the id is a ULID and
   therefore carries no engagement name. There is **no validation anywhere on this
   path**: the value is interpolated raw into the request line exactly as supplied,
   so a slug — or any other text an operator types — reaches the wire unmodified.
   The narrowness of the POST body (``invited_user_ids`` only) bounds *that*
   request and nothing else; the id travels in the URL of every GET on the path.

   **What actually bounds this site is an ownership check before the request is
   built** — FR-001/FR-002/FR-003: establish from files under the acting root that
   this checkout owns the named decision, and refuse otherwise, so a divergence
   becomes a loud refusal rather than a silent cross-project send. Until that gate
   is in place on this path, treat the entry as *unbounded*, not as bounded by the
   id's shape. If the endpoint ever grows a slug-accepting form the exposure widens
   again, and the id must be resolved to its owning project first.

What would falsify the SaaS enumeration: a daemon, sweep or batch constructing
one client and reusing it across projects; a widen flow driven from a checkout
other than the mission's own; or any future endpoint that accepts an identifier
whose owner is not derivable from the root the client was built with. A root that
is not a project root resolves to no uuid and therefore denies — a safety net,
not a substitute, because it does not catch a *valid* root for the *wrong*
project.
