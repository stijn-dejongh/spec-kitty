"""Mission read-path resolution (WP08 T037, FR-030).

Read-side CLI commands — ``spec-kitty agent tasks status``,
``agent context resolve``, ``agent decision verify`` — must locate
``status.events.jsonl`` / ``status.json`` / ``decisions/index.json``
regardless of the operator's current working directory.  The truth lives
in one of two places depending on mission topology:

* **New topology** (post-WP03): the coordination worktree at
  ``<repo_root>/.worktrees/<slug>-<mid8>-coord/kitty-specs/<slug>-<mid8>/``.
  All lane processes write through ``BookkeepingTransaction``, which
  commits to that worktree; lanes themselves do not carry the status
  files (sparse-checkout policy excludes them).
* **Legacy mission** (pre-WP03): no coord worktree exists.  The status
  files live in the primary checkout at
  ``<repo_root>/kitty-specs/<slug>[-<mid8>]/``.

The resolver returns the directory containing those files.  It does
**not** assert their presence — the caller decides whether absence is
an error (and surfaces ``STATUS_READ_PATH_NOT_FOUND`` accordingly).

    (``orchestrator_api/commands.py:_resolve_mission_dir`` + ``_read_primary_meta``).
    Every read-side migration consumes this so exactly ONE definition exists
    (NFR-004).

    Body (the prototype pattern, in order):

    1. ``assert_safe_path_segment(handle)`` — the traversal guard fires FIRST,
       before any ``KITTY_SPECS_DIR`` join (FR-004 / NFR-002).
    2. Read the primary ``meta.json`` (:func:`read_primary_meta`) to learn the
       declared identity and whether the topology declares a coordination branch.
    3. ``resolve_declared_mid8(meta, handle)`` — the ONE sanctioned mid8 cascade
       (NFR-005): ``meta.mid8`` → ``resolve_mid8(meta.mission_id)`` →
       ``mid8_from_slug(handle)``. Returns ``""`` on exhaustion (no raise).
    4. Fail-closed coord-declared gate (M5): a coord topology whose primary
       declares ``coordination_branch`` while identity CANNOT be proven (empty
       ``mid8``) cannot be addressed against the coord worktree; reading primary
       would expose stale status, so raise the typed read-path error rather than
       silently fall back.
    5. Return :func:`_resolve_mission_read_path` — the **existence-gated** topology
       resolver.

    ROUTING INVARIANT (FR-005, #1718 trap — binding): step 5 routes through
    :func:`_resolve_mission_read_path`, which selects the coord surface ONLY when
    the coord worktree directory EXISTS on disk. It MUST NOT route through
    ``resolve_status_surface_with_anchor`` (or any composing surface): that
    composes and returns the coord path for an *unmaterialised* coord, so a
    declared-but-not-yet-created coord (the ``mission create`` → first
    coord-materialisation window) would regress to a non-existent coord path
    instead of the correct PRIMARY read. Deriving a non-empty ``mid8`` is
    ORTHOGONAL to the create-window→primary contract — a declared-but-unmaterialised
    coord with a perfectly good ``mid8`` still resolves PRIMARY because no worktree
    dir is on disk.

    ``require_exists`` is forwarded UNCHANGED to :func:`_resolve_mission_read_path`.
    Under ``require_exists=True`` the read-path leg adopts WP01's
    :func:`probe_coord_state` discriminator for the whole coord fail-closed family
    (WP05 / T022): ``DELETED`` hard-fails :class:`CoordinationBranchDeleted`
    (converging with the surface), ``EMPTY`` returns PRIMARY (WP04 Option B), and
    ``UNMATERIALIZED`` keeps the #1718 create-window primary read.

    Args:
        repo_root: Absolute repository root (primary checkout).
        handle: Mission handle — bare slug, ``<slug>-<mid8>``, full ``mission_id``,
            bare ``mid8``, or numeric prefix.
        require_exists: Forwarded to :func:`_resolve_mission_read_path`; when
            ``True``, a genuine absence raises :class:`StatusReadPathNotFound`.
        resolver: Optional :class:`~mission_runtime.MissionResolver` threaded
            through the bare-modern fold and the existence-gated resolver's own
            identity probe (WP03, FR-002) — this is THE guarded read-side seam,
            so every shell caller (``_resolve_mission_slug`` et al.) that injects
            a resolver here reaches the single walk with no bypass. ``None``
            preserves historical behaviour.

    Returns:
        Absolute path to the mission directory containing the status read surface.

        ValueError: When ``handle`` is not a safe path segment (traversal guard).

    The single **resolve-dir-or-typed-error delegator** (FR-009/T4): wraps the
    canonical :func:`resolve_status_surface` so the two historically-duplicated
    wrappers — ``status.aggregate.MissionStatus._resolve_read_dir`` (WP04) and
    ``mission_runtime.resolution._resolve_status_surface_dir`` (WP05) — collapse
    onto ONE resolution body. Both wrappers re-point here in their owning WPs.

    Reconciled fallback / exception policy (the two old wrappers DIFFERED; this
    is the chosen union, documented per the WP03 DoD):

    * **Surface fail-closed** — ``resolve_status_surface`` raises
      :class:`StatusReadPathNotFound` (coord worktree materialised but its
      mission dir is absent, #1718/#1589): this is propagated UNCHANGED. Each
      caller translates it to its own boundary type (aggregate →
      ``CoordAuthorityUnavailable``; mission_runtime → ``ActionContextError``)
      — the delegator does NOT pick one translation, because the typed-error
      convergence is WP06's job (the equivalence matrix's ``coord-empty`` /
      ``coord-deleted`` cells stay RED until then). Propagating the raw
      ``StatusReadPathNotFound`` keeps the ``error_code`` intact for either
      translation.
    * **Meta absent / malformed** — ``resolve_status_surface`` raises
      :class:`FileNotFoundError` (no ``meta.json`` yet: the create→first-write
      window) or :class:`ValueError` (malformed slug/meta). The UNION of the two
      old wrappers caught both; this delegator catches both and returns the
      caller-supplied ``on_missing_meta`` directory. The two old wrappers
      differed only in HOW they spelled that primary fallback (aggregate passed
      a pre-computed ``primary_candidate``; mission_runtime recomputed
      ``candidate_feature_dir_for_mission``) — the ``on_missing_meta`` parameter
      lets each caller keep its own spelling while sharing this body.
    * **Success** — returns ``surface.parent`` (the directory containing
      ``status.events.jsonl``), the value both old wrappers returned.

    The unmaterialised-coord gate that ``aggregate._resolve_read_dir`` applies
    (``is_under_worktrees_segment(dir) and not dir.exists()`` →
    ``primary_candidate``) is intentionally NOT folded in here: it is a second,
    aggregate-specific authority decision layered ON TOP of resolution, so it
    stays at the aggregate call site (WP04) where ``on_missing_meta`` already
    carries the primary candidate.

    Args:
        repo_root: Absolute repository root (primary checkout).
        mission_slug: Mission slug or handle (resolved by the surface authority).
        on_missing_meta: Directory to return when no identity-bearing
            ``meta.json`` exists yet (the primary checkout is authoritative in
            the create→first-write window).

    Returns:
        Absolute path to the mission directory containing the status surface.

    Raises:
        StatusReadPathNotFound: When the surface authority fails closed (coord
            worktree materialised without its mission dir). Propagated unchanged
            so each caller applies its own typed-error translation.

    This is the **single read primitive** (C-005 / FR-002): it delegates to
    :func:`_resolve_mission_read_path`, deriving ``mid8`` once from the slug. The
    historical ``missions.feature_dir_resolver`` shim that re-exported this
    function was retired in WP07 (FR-007); every caller now imports it from this
    canonical module directly.

    Because it routes through :func:`_resolve_mission_read_path`, a bare ``mid8``
    handle (e.g. ``01KTPKST``) resolves to the same directory as the full slug
    (F-001/F-003/F-004) for every one of the 30+ callers, not just the read-side
    CLI commands.

    FR-006 (structural #2062 — the surface/aggregate read-leg close): this
    primitive feeds the canonical surface resolver
    (:func:`coordination.surface_resolver.resolve_status_surface_with_anchor`)
    AND the aggregate's ``MissionStatus._find_meta_path``. Both legs are the ones
    ``agent status`` / kanban / dep-gate / review-claim actually use. So this
    primitive reads the WP02 **stored** ``topology`` from the primary ``meta.json``
    ONCE (via the SAME :func:`read_primary_meta` / :func:`stored_topology_from_meta`
    seam the guarded :func:`resolve_handle_to_read_path` leg uses — NOT a fresh
    ``coordination_branch is None`` re-inference) and threads it into the
    existence-gated resolver. A mission whose stored topology is coord-less
    (``SINGLE_BRANCH`` / ``LANES``) therefore resolves PRIMARY **regardless** of a
    stale, registered, meta-bearing ``-coord`` husk on disk — the husk is
    structurally not consulted, so a prior flatten that left a husk cannot re-open
    #2062 on these legs. A coord-routing stored topology (or an un-backfilled
    legacy mission, ``topology is None``) keeps its historical husk-consulting
    behaviour (C-006), so a genuine coord mission still reads the coord worktree.

    Like the historical implementation it never raises ``StatusReadPathNotFound``
    on a missing directory — it returns the best-known primary candidate so the
    caller can render its own diagnostic. It DOES propagate
    :class:`MissionSelectorAmbiguous` (C-CTX-4 / C-009 — an ambiguous selector is
    a structured error, never a silent wrong-but-plausible directory).

    ``resolver`` (WP03, FR-002): optional :class:`~mission_runtime.MissionResolver`
    threaded through the bare-modern fold and the existence-gated resolver's own

      (#1718 create-window, #1848 coord-deleted) — the append-only event log stays
      on coordination for coord-topology missions (C-001), so a STATUS read still
      resolves the coord worktree.

    The classification is the single partition the write side already owns;
    flipping a kind across the partition is a one-line move in
    ``mission_runtime.artifacts`` (NFR-004), never a code change here.

    Args:
        repo_root: Absolute repository root (primary checkout).
        mission_slug: Mission slug or handle (resolved by the underlying primitive).
        kind: The artifact kind being READ — decides the partition.
        resolver: Optional :class:`~mission_runtime.MissionResolver` threaded to
            both underlying primitives (WP03, FR-002). ``None`` preserves
            historical behaviour.

    Returns:
        Absolute mission directory for that kind's read surface.

    Raises:
        ValueError: When ``mission_slug`` is not a safe path segment (traversal
            guard — propagated from the underlying primitive).
        MissionSelectorAmbiguous: When ``mission_slug`` is an ambiguous handle —
            propagated unchanged from the PRIMARY-leg caller-canonicalization
            (:func:`_canonicalize_primary_read_handle`, FR-011) or, for a
            STATUS-partition kind, from the topology-aware seam. No silent pick.

    never raises on a missing directory (unlike
    :func:`resolve_feature_dir_for_mission`). It delegates to the single
    coord-aware path primitive (:func:`_resolve_mission_read_path`), so
    coordination topology is honoured exactly once.

    Relocated here from the retired ``missions.feature_dir_resolver`` shim
    (WP07/FR-007). The late imports keep importing this module from pulling in
    heavier modules during cold ``spec-kitty next`` startup.

    read-surface-ssot-closeout-01KWZV91/WP09 (FR-001, NFR-001): the last four
    production call sites (``materialize.py``, ``research.py``,
    ``validate_encoding.py``, ``workspace/context.py``) were routed onto
    ``placement_seam(...).read_dir(kind)`` — the kind-aware seam, not this
    kind-blind primitive. This function stays a genuine, still-exercised
    coord-aware primitive (dozens of tests call it directly to prove the
    coord-vs-primary split — see ``tests/retrospective/``,
    ``tests/integration/test_coord_loop_*``,
    ``tests/architectural/test_gate_read_literal_ban.py``), so it is NOT

    ``tests/architectural/test_no_dead_symbols.py``, requires one for an
    exported name). Direct qualified imports (``from ... import
    resolve_feature_dir_for_slug``) are unaffected by ``__all__`` membership.

    FR-004 (T015 boundary absorption, WP17): like
    :func:`candidate_feature_dir_for_mission`, this leg reads the WP02 stored
    topology ONCE and threads it down so the absent-``topology``-field case is
    ABSORBED to a concrete shape — a flattened mission resolves PRIMARY even
    un-backfilled, and the resolver's ``topology is None`` arm is reached ONLY for a
    corrupt/unreadable meta (the C-004 legacy probe fallback), never for a readable
    no-topology meta. The read stays resilient (the best-effort reader degrades a
    malformed meta to ``None``), preserving the never-raise contract.
