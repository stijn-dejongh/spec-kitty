"""Mission archiving — a first-class lifecycle operation (FR-015 / US6 / IC-13).

Archiving turns a *terminal* mission (``merged`` or ``canceled``) into an
immutable, explicitly-legacy :class:`ArchivedMission` snapshot: it is excluded
from live validation but kept **enumerable**, so retiring a mission never hides
unresolved state.

The four ``AM`` guards are the whole point of this surface — an ungoverned
archive would be a one-command escape from any acceptance failure:

* **AM-1 — Terminal only.** Archiving is refused unless the mission is already
  terminal (``merged`` / ``canceled``), and always requires a stated reason.
* **AM-2 — No violation may be filed away.** Archiving is refused while any
  negative invariant is recorded ``still_present`` — a violation is resolved,
  not archived past.
* **AM-3 — Visible, not deleted.** An archived mission drops out of live
  validation (:func:`is_mission_archived`) but stays enumerable
  (:func:`list_archived_missions`), so the debt remains discoverable.
* **AM-4 — Never automatic.** Archiving is operator-invoked only. It is
  unreachable from any lifecycle step, including the FR-014 backfill migration:
  there is no automated caller — ``archived_by`` is a required operator
  identity with no default, and no migration module imports this one.
* **AM-5 — Cancellation clears deferrals; abandonment is not a deadlock.**
  Cancelling a mission resolves its outstanding ``deferred_to_consolidation``
  invariants to a ``canceled`` disposition (they were never going to be judged —
  the mission is abandoned, not completed), so an abandoned mission with a
  dangling deferral is still archivable. Deferrals never block archiving here;
  only ``still_present`` does (AM-2).

The authority boundary: this module *reads* the canonical status snapshot and
acceptance matrix and *appends* to an immutable registry. It never re-implements
status reduction or matrix parsing, and never mutates mission state.
