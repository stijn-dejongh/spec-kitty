"""MissionStatus aggregate root — Mission Management domain (WP04, FR-015–FR-023).

``MissionStatus`` is the authoritative read/write owner of mission WP lane state
within the Mission Management domain.  It encapsulates topology resolution,
the coord-aware read path, and lane transitions behind a single clean façade.

Usage::

    ms = MissionStatus.load(repo_root=Path("."), mission_slug="034-feature")
    wp_status = ms.claim("WP01")
    lane = wp_status.current_lane

Key constraints
---------------
* ``BookkeepingTransaction`` internals are NOT changed (C-004). ``MissionStatus``
  wraps it, does not replace it.
* When the coord worktree has been materialized but lacks the mission dir,
  ``CoordAuthorityUnavailable`` is raised. Before materialization, the primary
  checkout remains authoritative for the create→first-write window.
* All status reads go through the ``status/`` façade (never direct submodule
  imports from callers).

          create→first-write window) and returns the caller-supplied primary
          directory, so the primary checkout stays authoritative until first
          write (mutation-guarded by ``test_create_first_write_window_*``).
        * **StatusReadPathNotFound → CoordAuthorityUnavailable** — the delegator
          propagates the surface's fail-closed signal unchanged (typed-error
          convergence is WP06's job); the aggregate translates it to its own
          historical boundary type here.
        * **Unmaterialised-coord create-window gate** — when the canonical
          :func:`resolve_status_surface` composes a coord path whose worktree is
          declared but **not yet materialised** (coord branch in meta, pre-first
          write), it returns that composed coord path *as-is* and explicitly
          defers the authority decision to this call site (see the WP03
          delegator docstring: this gate "stays at the aggregate call site"). The
          aggregate keeps the primary checkout authoritative until the coord
          worktree exists, matching the historical ``coord_candidate.exists()``
          semantics — a shape-only check on a not-yet-materialised path, so it
          consumes the blessed ``is_under_worktrees_segment`` shape predicate
          rather than the (git-touching) registry authority.

        The body that re-implemented ``resolve_status_surface``'s happy/error
        tail inline (the ``FileNotFoundError`` → primary and the
        ``StatusReadPathNotFound`` translation) is **consolidated** onto the one
        WP03 delegator (FR-009/T4); only the two genuinely aggregate-specific
        concerns above remain at this seam. C-004: the consolidation is gated on
        WP02's equivalence matrix staying green/xfail-tracked for aggregate's
