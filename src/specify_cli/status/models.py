    """Canonical work package lifecycle states.

    ``GENESIS`` is the pre-finalize state of a work package that has been
    created (``WPCreated``) but not yet seeded into the lane lifecycle. It is
    distinct from ``PLANNED`` so that ``finalize-tasks`` seeds a real
    ``genesis -> planned`` transition instead of a no-op ``planned -> planned``
    self-transition, and so the lane-state readers never silently default an
    unfinalized WP to ``planned``.

    ``GENESIS`` is a *non-display* lane: it is never the current lane of a
    materialized WP (an unseeded WP has no lane events and so is absent from the
    snapshot; once seeded it is ``planned``). It therefore does not appear on
    the kanban board or in the board summary. The nine post-genesis states
    (``PLANNED``..``CANCELED``) are the active, displayed lifecycle lanes.

    ``UNINITIALIZED`` is a *non-display, non-transitionable read sentinel*
    returned by the lane-reader surface (``lane_reader.get_wp_lane`` /
    ``get_all_wp_lanes``) when a WP is **absent from the reduced snapshot**
    (no events yet) or the event log **exists but is empty**. It is
    deliberately **distinct** from ``GENESIS``: ``GENESIS`` means "seeded WP
    on an unseeded lane" (has a ``WPCreated`` event, pre-finalize), while
    ``UNINITIALIZED`` means "no lane events exist for this WP at all" (a pure
    read-time absence marker). ``UNINITIALIZED`` is never persisted to the
    event log, never appears as a ``from_lane``/``to_lane`` in a transition,
    and never appears in a display summary — see ``NON_DISPLAY_LANES`` below,
    which is the single canonical authority for "which lanes never display."

    # of which transition (or no transition at all) accompanies the
