"""Per-mission status locking for shared planning artifacts.

Serializes access to mission-level status artifacts that are written on the
planning checkout (`status.events.jsonl`, `status.json`, and `tasks.md`).
Parallel agents may run from separate worktrees, but they still converge on
the same planning repo paths, so these writes need an inter-process lock.
