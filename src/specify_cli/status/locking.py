"""Per-mission status locking for shared planning artifacts.

Serializes access to mission-level status artifacts that are written on the
planning checkout (`status.events.jsonl`, `status.json`, and `tasks.md`).
Parallel agents may run from separate worktrees, but they still converge on
the same planning repo paths, so these writes need an inter-process lock.

Lock rules (fsm-write-path-integrity-01M1TZV6 WP01, FR-003; the full
hierarchy is in that mission's ``design-notes/WP01-lock-rules.md``):

* (a)/(b) -- outage-shaped takes are bounded: every acquisition reachable
  from the verdict-save queue scope and the merge-path retrospective take
  passes a finite ``timeout`` (:data:`BOUNDED_STATUS_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
  is the shared bound) and surfaces a :class:`FeatureStatusLockTimeoutError`
  that names the lock file and, when recorded, the holder.
* (c) -- one lock key: :func:`feature_status_lock_path` is keyed on the
  mission directory name (``feature_dir.name``), never on a mission slug
  (FR-004 / C-003). Two missions with colliding slugs get distinct lock files;
  a bare legacy slug directory's writers share the file its pipeline writers
  use.
