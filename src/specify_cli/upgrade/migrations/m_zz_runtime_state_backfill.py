"""Migration ``runtime_state_backfill``: corpus-wide cutover for existing deployments.

Realises **IC-02** (plan.md) / **FR-010** / **US3**: an *auto-discovered* upgrade
migration that runs ``backfill -> fail-closed verify -> status_phase flip`` over
**every** mission in an existing deployment's ``kitty-specs/`` corpus, so a
big-bang production-default flip of the snapshot-authority reader never strands
an un-migrated on-disk WP.

This migration is **fail-closed and stricter than the operator CLI** (research
D-03): ``spec-kitty migrate backfill-runtime-state`` treats each mission as an
independent best-effort unit (one mission's failure does not block the rest).
This migration instead aborts the **whole step** on the first mission whose
verify fails, with an operator-actionable message naming the mission and the
specific mismatch. Missions that already passed earlier in the same run stay
flipped -- each one was independently verified before it flipped, so nothing is
ever half-flipped (per-mission atomicity, *not* a corpus-wide rollback -- there
is no cross-mission transaction primitive to roll back with, D-03).

Reuse, not re-implementation (D-01)
------------------------------------
The one and only verify-then-flip spine lives in
:func:`specify_cli.migration.runtime_state_cutover.cutover_mission` (WP01). This
module calls it once per mission and adds nothing to the write path itself --
only the corpus walk and the fail-closed abort-on-first-failure control flow are
new here. The write target is canonicalized *inside* that reused helper, so this
migration never touches ``Path.cwd()`` and never writes at the repository root
(INV-5 / C-003 / #2815).

THE VERSION-KEY ORDERING TRAP (load-bearing -- read before editing the filename)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
``MigrationRegistry.get_all()`` sorts registered migrations by
``Version(target_version)``; same-version ties keep **registry insertion
order**, which is **alphabetical module-discovery order**
(``pkgutil.iter_modules`` sorts filenames before ``auto_discover_migrations()``
imports them -- verified empirically). FR-010 requires this migration to run
strictly **after** the charter-fold migrations
(``m_unify_charter_activation.py`` / ``m_unify_charter_activation_finalize.py``,
both ``target_version = "3.2.6rc1"``). Two ways to get this wrong:

1. **A ``target_version`` above ``"3.2.6rc1"``** (e.g. ``"3.3.1"``, matching the
   pre-flight brief's original filename): the installed/unreleased package
   version is ``3.2.6`` (see ``pyproject.toml``), and
   ``MigrationRegistry.get_applicable()`` only includes a migration when
   ``target <= to_version`` -- a higher ``target_version`` is **silently
   skipped** by real upgrades, and separately HARD-FAILs
   ``tests/architectural/test_migration_chain_integrity.py`` (chain end ahead of
   ``pyproject.toml``). Fix: tie the version at ``"3.2.6rc1"``, shipping within the
   same, still-unreleased cycle as the charter folds and
   ``m_3_2_6_meta_traces_merge_drivers.py``.
2. **A numeric-prefix filename at the tied version** (e.g.
   ``m_3_3_1_runtime_state_backfill.py``): digit ``'3'`` (0x33) sorts *before*
   letter ``'u'`` (0x75), so such a module would import -- and register --
   *before* ``m_unify_charter_activation*.py``, running this migration BEFORE
   the charter folds it must follow. No ``m_<digits>_*`` filename can win that
   alphabetical tie against ``m_unify_*``. This module is therefore named
   ``m_zz_runtime_state_backfill.py`` -- ``'z'`` (0x7a) sorts after ``'u'``, so
   it is guaranteed, not incidental, to import after both charter-fold modules
   at the same ``target_version``. The ``zz_`` prefix is a deliberate ordering
   marker (mirroring how ``m_unify_charter_activation_finalize.py`` encodes its
   own ordering constraint in its filename); the semantic, stable identifier
   stays on ``migration_id`` below. The auto-discovery/ordering test locks this
   property in as a regression guard.

No-op / idempotency (NFR-002, C-003)
--------------------------------------
``detect()`` is a **fast skip-hint**, not the idempotency source of truth
(research D-02): it short-circuits per mission on an already snapshot-authority
``status_phase`` (cheap, no I/O beyond ``meta.json``), and otherwise falls back
to a read-only legacy-state scan. ``apply()`` never trusts this hint for
correctness -- it always re-derives the true idempotent outcome through
:func:`cutover_mission` itself (whose backfill mints deterministic seed ids and
whose flip short-circuits once already at authority), so a second ``apply()``
over an unchanged corpus seeds nothing and re-flips nothing.

Dry-run and the fail-closed check (WP01 contract, not new here)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
``cutover_mission``'s dry-run seed phase computes the would-seed count
*without writing*, so on a never-yet-seeded mission the fail-closed verify --
which always reads the REAL on-disk event log -- legitimately cannot confirm
parity yet; that is "nothing written yet," not corruption. This migration's
abort check therefore only treats a non-``ok`` verify as fatal on a **live**
run; a dry-run preview reports the would-seed count and never aborts on that
expected pre-write mismatch (a structural error still aborts a dry-run, same
as live).
