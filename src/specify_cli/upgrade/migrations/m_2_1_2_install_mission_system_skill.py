"""Migration: install the new mission-system skill for consumer projects.

The spec-kitty-mission-system skill explains how missions work, the 4 built-in
missions, template resolution, guards, and mission selection. It is a new skill
added in 2.1.2 — not a fix to an existing one.

Installs SKILL.md and references/mission-comparison-matrix.md to all configured
agent skill roots.
