"""Migration 4.0.0rc5: install the decisions/index.json union merge driver.

Sibling of ``m_3_1_1_event_log_merge_driver.py`` (status.events.jsonl),
``m_3_2_6_decisions_event_log_merge_driver.py`` (decisions.events.jsonl) and
``m_3_2_7_review_cycle_merge_driver.py`` (review-cycle-*.md):
coord-artifact-single-home-01M3V4BE WP11 (FR-009b / D13 / #5023) registers
``spec-kitty-decision-index`` for already-initialized (upgraded) consumer
clones, the same way those migrations registered their own drivers.

**``target_version`` equals the installed package version.** Unlike
``m_3_2_7``'s documented mismatch (filename vs. ``target_version``, chosen
because the installed package was a release candidate below the module's own
number), this repository's installed ``pyproject.toml`` version IS
``4.0.0rc5`` at the time this migration is authored, so ``target_version``
is pinned to that exact string. ``spec-kitty upgrade`` /
``test_discovered_migration_targets_do_not_exceed_package_version`` skip/flag
any migration whose ``target_version`` exceeds the installed package
version -- a project already AT ``4.0.0rc5`` therefore only gains this
driver via its own ``detect()`` returning ``True`` (the ``.gitattributes``
line or the local git config is missing), never via a version bump alone
(``upgrade/registry.py``'s eligibility check).

The driver this migration seeds unions ``decisions/index.json`` ``entries``
keyed by ``decision_id`` with terminal-beats-open fold precedence (see
``run_decision_index_driver``'s docstring in ``consolidation/drivers.py``)
so two lanes that each add a decision never lose either entry under the
mission->target squash. This migration only wires the *registration*
surfaces (``.gitattributes`` entry + local git config); the reconciliation
semantics live entirely in the driver command it points at.

**Command form:** this migration writes the bare ``spec-kitty
merge-driver-decision-index %O %A %B`` command, byte-identical in shape to
every existing driver's ``command=`` string in
``specify_cli.lanes.consolidation._MERGE_DRIVERS`` -- see ``m_3_2_7``'s own
docstring for why a migration never hardcodes an environment-specific
interpreter path.
