"""Migration: install canonical skill pack into existing projects.

Discovers canonical skills from the doctrine layer and installs them into
all configured agent skill roots using the managed skill manifest system.
This brings existing 2.0.11+ projects up to parity with fresh ``spec-kitty init``
behavior for skill distribution.

Scope:
- Discovers all canonical skills from src/doctrine/skills/
- Installs skills for all configured agents per the capability matrix
- Creates .kittify/skills-manifest.json with installed file tracking
- Skips wrapper-only agents (no skill root)
- Deduplicates shared-root installations
