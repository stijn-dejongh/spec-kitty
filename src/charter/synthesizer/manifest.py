"""Synthesis manifest writer — WP03 (T017).

Owns the ``SynthesisManifest`` and ``ManifestArtifactEntry`` Pydantic models
plus their IO helpers.

The manifest is written **last** in the promote pipeline (KD-2 authority
rule): a partial promote (e.g. crashed after some ``os.replace`` calls but
before the manifest write) leaves the live tree in an authors-but-no-manifest
state that readers treat as partial-and-rerunable.

Storage location: ``.kittify/charter/synthesis-manifest.yaml``

Data model reference: data-model.md §E-6 / §E-6a.
Schema reference: contracts/synthesis-manifest.schema.yaml.

All filesystem writes go through ``PathGuard`` (FR-016).
