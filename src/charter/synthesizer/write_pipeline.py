"""Stage-and-promote write pipeline — WP03 (T018).

Public entry point: ``promote(request, staging_dir, results, validation_callback)``

This module implements KD-2 (atomicity model):

    stage → validate → ordered-os.replace → manifest-last → wipe

Authority rule (KD-2): the live tree is authoritative IFF the synthesis
manifest (``.kittify/charter/synthesis-manifest.yaml``) is present AND all
listed ``content_hash`` values match on-disk artifact bytes.  A partial
promote (crash between promote start and manifest write) leaves the live tree
in an authored-but-no-manifest state → readers treat it as partial-and-
rerunable.

Step ordering (enforced by this module):
    1. Write every (body, provenance) pair into the staged subtrees.
    2. Call ``validation_callback(staging_dir)`` — raises → abort to .failed/.
    3. Ordered ``os.replace`` (via PathGuard) into final live trees.
    4. Write manifest last (the sole mutation after content os.replace calls).
    5. ``staging_dir.wipe()``.
    6. Return the manifest.

On any exception between step 3 and step 4 the staging dir is NOT wiped —
the ``StagingDir`` context manager in the caller routes it to ``.failed/``.

All filesystem writes go through ``PathGuard`` (FR-016).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Typed staged-artifact entry (WP02 — Charter Contract Cleanup Tranche 1)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ``StagedArtifact`` is the typed entry returned by ``compute_written_artifacts``
# below. It is the single source of truth for the ``written_artifacts`` array
# emitted by ``charter synthesize --json`` (FR-003), and powers the byte-equal
# dry-run / non-dry-run path-parity guarantee (FR-004).
#
# Shape mirrors the ``WrittenArtifact`` contract from
# ``contracts/synthesis-envelope.schema.json``:
#
#   * ``path``        — repo-relative POSIX path that the live tree will (or
#                       did) carry. Computed from the same helpers
#                       ``promote()`` uses below — see ``_artifact_filename``
#                       and ``_doctrine_kind_subdir`` — so dry-run and
#                       non-dry-run agree byte-for-byte.
#   * ``kind``        — doctrine kind (``directive`` / ``tactic`` / ``styleguide``)
#                       lifted directly from ``ProvenanceEntry.artifact_kind``.
#   * ``slug``        — slug component lifted from ``ProvenanceEntry.artifact_slug``.
#   * ``artifact_id`` — concrete artifact identifier extracted from
#                       ``ProvenanceEntry.artifact_urn``. ``None`` for kinds
#                       that do not carry a URN-encoded id (tactic, styleguide).
#                       The CLI surface MUST NOT expose the placeholder
#                       ``PROJECT_000``; it is rejected here as well so a
#                       missing-provenance regression cannot silently leak.
#
# The dataclass is frozen so callers cannot mutate provenance after the fact.
# Adding fields here is safe (additive); removing/renaming would break the
# CLI envelope shape and is out of scope.
