"""Charter facade for DRG (Doctrine Reference Graph) types + org layer (Slice F).

This module is the charter-layer proxy for runtime callers that historically
imported from ``doctrine.drg`` directly. The runtime → charter → doctrine
boundary (ADR 2026-03-27-1, tightened by mission
``charter-mediated-doctrine-selection-01KRTZCA``) requires runtime modules
under ``src/specify_cli/`` to reach doctrine artifacts only through such
charter facades.

This file is partly a pure re-export module — and partly the home of the
Slice F WP06 organisation-tier DRG loader (``load_org_drg``,
``merge_three_layers``, ``OrgDRGConflictError``). The org-DRG additions live
in the charter layer per the architectural constraint that anything new in the
doctrine-overlay space must be reachable by ``specify_cli`` only through
``charter``.

Schema / fragment models live in ``doctrine.drg.org_pack_loader``
(PR #1119 DDD-boundary fix): ``OrgDRGFragment``, ``OrgPackMissingError``.
Charter re-exports them here so existing ``from charter.drg import …`` call
sites remain valid without crossing the layer boundary directly.

Slice F WP06 design notes
-------------------------

The org-DRG fragment schema (``OrgDRGFragment``) intentionally uses a
simpler node/edge shape than ``doctrine.drg.models.DRGNode`` /
``DRGEdge``. The reason is C-009: the contract round-trip gate exercises
the YAML example in
``kitty-specs/<mission>/contracts/org-drg-schema.md`` which uses plural
kinds (``kind: directives``) and human-friendly fields (``id``, ``title``,
``body_path``). The built-in DRGNode uses URNs and singular enum kinds. To
satisfy both surfaces:

* Fragment-side parsing uses private node/edge models declared in
  ``doctrine.drg.org_pack_loader``. Their ``kind`` field is constrained
  to the Mission B 8-kind plural universe (C-009 binding).
* ``merge_three_layers`` bridges fragment nodes onto the built-in DRG by
  minting URNs of the form ``<singular_kind>:<id>`` (e.g. ``directive:sox-controls``).
* Provenance is threaded via the declared ``provenance`` field on the DRG
  models (FR-013, D2-revised). The merge returns a ``DRGGraph`` whose node /
  edge objects carry their ``provenance`` set through ``model_copy``;
  consumers read it directly with ``node.provenance``.

This matches data-model.md §2's stated provenance semantics
(``source: built-in | org:<pack> | project``) while honouring the
contract YAML shape that the FR-140 round-trip gate enforces.

    This function is project-config-aware (charter-domain): it reads the

# Activation filter (FR-006, FR-018, WP11)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Mission ``charter-doctrine-mission-type-configuration-01KSWJVX`` WP11.
#
# FR-018 specifies that DRG traversal is activation-filtered: only doctrine
# artifacts that are explicitly activated in the project charter are visible
# to charter-mediated resolution. "Activated" and "registered" are synonyms
# per the data-model. The filter is sourced from ``PackContext``:
#
# * ``PackContext.activated_kinds``           — plural artifact kinds the
#                                                charter has opted in to.
# * ``PackContext.activated_mission_types``   — mission type IDs the charter
#                                                has opted in to.
#
# FR-006's two-tier directive scope is honoured by this filter because
# mission-type-scoped directives only enter the resolved set when that
# mission type is activated. Project-scoped directives
# (``required_directives`` from the top-level charter) are never gated by
# the activation filter — they apply unconditionally to every mission.
#
# CRITICAL INVARIANT (WP11 T069): the activation filter applies ONLY to
# charter-mediated resolution paths. Direct doctrine-API callers
# (``MissionTemplateRepository.get(...)``, ``service.directives.get(...)``,
# etc.) bypass this filter and continue to return non-activated artifacts.
# This is by design: non-activated artifacts are non-canonical for charter
# resolution but remain reachable on operator request.

       fall through to the kind filter (defensive default-allow).
    2. All other kinds: the singular URN prefix is mapped to its plural form

       extension kind not yet in :data:`_SINGULAR_TO_PLURAL`) is allowed
       through so the filter never silently swallows new artifact kinds —
       the DRG schema validator is the gatekeeper for kind legality.
    3. Per-artifact-ID gate (FR-038, WP08; canonical-URN corrected, WP01):
       after the kind-level check, the pre-resolved canonical-URN set for
       this kind is consulted. ``None`` (key absent from config) means all
