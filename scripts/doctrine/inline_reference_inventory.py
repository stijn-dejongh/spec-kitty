"""Enumerate every inline relationship-bearing field under ``packs/built-in/``.

Mission ``doctrine-canonical-structure-remediation-01KYEYSD`` (FR-013/FR-015).

**Why this exists as a script rather than a number in a spec.** The migration
inventory was measured by hand twice and was wrong both times: the first pass read
only top-level ``references:`` (missing 15 step-level entries in 13 step positions,
4 of whose files carry *no* top-level block at all, so a file-driven migration would
never have opened them), and neither pass counted the five sibling surfaces
(``directive_refs``, ``tactic_refs``, ``tactic-references``, ``directive-references``,
``context-sources.*``). A spec that hardcodes a count an implementer cannot reproduce
makes the completion gate unfalsifiable — it pins whatever someone counted that day.
So the count is *derived*, here, and the gate imports this module rather than
restating a literal.

**The classification that matters.** Not every inline entry denotes an artefact
relationship, and conflating them is what made the earlier reading hazardous:

* ``MIGRATE`` — denotes an artefact→artefact relationship that the extractor turns
  into a DRG edge. These move to the authored-edge tier.
* ``GOVERNANCE`` — ``directive-references`` on agent profiles (the retired
  ``context-sources.*`` surface was removed in mission
  doctrine-drg-silent-drop-boundary-01M0PE7E). These seed the charter governance
  closure (``src/charter/resolver.py`` reads ``profile.directive_references`` as
  the transitive-resolution seed set), so they are classified GOVERNANCE for
  bulk-edit *disposition* — a rename mission must never blindly sweep a governed
  directive code. (Since that same mission, ``directive-references`` ALSO mints a
  DRG ``requires`` edge at the extractor — it is now dual-purpose; the GOVERNANCE
  label here is about rename-safety, not about minting zero edges.) They are NOT
  relationship residue and must not be swept into the migration.
* ``RAW_MATERIAL`` — path strings pointing at non-artefact files (READMEs, ADRs,
  templates). ``_resolve_path_ref`` fails closed on them by design, they produce no
  edge, and the doctrine README sanctions carrying them. They stay.

Run ``python scripts/doctrine/inline_reference_inventory.py --json`` for machine
output, or without flags for the operator table.
