"""Golden characterisation of the six registered merge drivers.

Pins each driver's byte-for-byte behavior so the driver body can live in
``consolidation/drivers.py`` -- decoupled from ``cli/commands/merge_driver.py`` --
without silently changing what it writes. Two legs per golden case:

- **subprocess leg** (``@pytest.mark.integration``): runs the registered
  command exactly as git would invoke it (``python -m specify_cli
  merge-driver-X O A B``), reusing :func:`_capture.capture_case`.
- **in-process leg** (``@pytest.mark.unit``): resolves the driver through the
  replay seam ``specify_cli.consolidation.git_probes._resolve_registered_driver_callable``
  -- never through ``specify_cli.cli.commands.merge_driver`` -- so this leg
  stays valid regardless of where the driver body lives.

Plus an all-six-resolve replay test: only ``traces`` is otherwise exercised
through replay (``test_bookkeeping_projection_seam.py``); this proves every
registered ``config_key`` resolves.
