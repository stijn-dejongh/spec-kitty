"""Tests for WP03 diff-coverage policy validation report.

Covers the contract surface defined in
kitty-specs/068-post-merge-reliability-and-release-hardening/contracts/diff_coverage_policy.md.

Tests:
- test_validation_report_authored        — report file exists and has all required sections
- test_decision_is_recorded              — exactly one decision is marked
- test_validation_report_close_path_populated  — content gate: non-vacuous rationale + findings
- test_close_with_evidence_does_not_modify_workflow  — only name: changes when closing
- test_tighten_workflow_passes_large_pr_sample  — active when tighten_workflow is chosen; verifies advisory-only contract via YAML inspection
