"""Dry-run / non-dry-run path-parity guards (WP02 — Charter Contract Cleanup Tranche 1).

These tests pin two contracts the mission spec calls out as load-bearing:

* **FR-004 (path parity).** ``charter synthesize --dry-run --json`` MUST
  report ``written_artifacts[*].path`` byte-equal to the path a subsequent
  non-dry-run with the same ``SynthesisRequest`` writes. The two code
  paths share a single derivation function
  (:func:`charter.synthesizer.write_pipeline.compute_written_artifacts`)
  so this test exists as a regression guard against drift.
* **FR-005 (no user-visible PROJECT_000).** No envelope value (string,
  key, or substring) emitted on stdout contains the placeholder
  ``PROJECT_000``. Internal-only use is acceptable; user-visible
  appearance is a hard failure.

The first test exercises the in-memory ``compute_written_artifacts``
helper directly so the parity check is independent of the CLI envelope
shape (the CLI test files in ``tests/integration/`` and
``tests/agent/cli/commands/`` cover the wire-level shape).

The second test invokes the actual ``charter synthesize --json`` command
through Typer's ``CliRunner`` and grep-asserts the placeholder is absent
from the entire JSON-serialised envelope.
