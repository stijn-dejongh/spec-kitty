"""End-to-end synthesis visibility tests for compiler/context consumers.

These tests exercise the real synthesis pipeline rather than writing fake
project doctrine files by hand. That keeps FR-018 / SC-005 honest: the charter
consumers should only see project-local doctrine after a successful synthesis.
