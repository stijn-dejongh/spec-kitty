"""Regression tests for P0 bug: _tag_source corrupted DRGEdge.source URN.

Before the fix (2026-05, Robert adversarial review), ``_tag_source`` wrote
provenance into an attribute named ``"source"``, which silently overwrote
``DRGEdge.source`` (the source-endpoint URN declared as a Pydantic field).
After ``merge_three_layers`` every edge's endpoint became ``"built-in"`` /
``"org:..."`` / ``"project"`` instead of the URN, causing false-positive
dangling-source findings in the DRG validator.

The fix renamed the sidecar attribute to ``"provenance"``.  These tests pin
the corrected behaviour.
