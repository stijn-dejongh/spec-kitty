"""Regression tests for the silent-swallow finding (S1/S2) from the
post-merge mission review of ``review-merge-gate-hardening-3-2-x-01KRC57C``,
plus ATDD for Pattern C activation filtering in ``charter.resolver.DoctrineService``
(WP09, T042).

The chokepoint at ``src/charter/_io.py`` correctly raises ``CharterEncodingError``
(a subclass of ``KittyInternalConsistencyError``) when encoding detection
cannot resolve unambiguously. The audit surfaced that the two CALL SITES
inside the charter subsystem wrap the call in ``except Exception`` and return
empty results — defeating FR-018's fail-loud guarantee at the consumer
boundary.

These tests verify that the diagnostic propagates through the call sites:

* ``_load_yaml_asset`` (compiler.py) — used to compile charter assets
* ``read_interview_answers`` (interview.py) — used to load interview state

The tests target *behavior*, not file line numbers. A future refactor that
moves the function or changes its name should still pass these tests as
long as the diagnostic propagation contract is honored.

Pattern C ATDD (T042)
---------------------
``DoctrineService.agent_profiles`` applies a three-state activation filter:

* ``pack_context=None`` → unfiltered (all profiles returned)
* ``pack_context.activated_agent_profiles is None`` → unfiltered (key absent from config)
* ``pack_context.activated_agent_profiles == frozenset()`` → empty dict (explicit opt-out)
* ``pack_context.activated_agent_profiles = {ids}`` → only those IDs returned

These tests use lightweight ``types.SimpleNamespace`` objects as mock pack
contexts because ``PackContext``'s per-kind three-state fields are added by
WP02 (approved dependency) and may not yet be available in the merged tree.
The ``DoctrineService`` wrapper only requires duck-typing on the per-kind
fields, so ``SimpleNamespace`` is the simplest correct fixture.
