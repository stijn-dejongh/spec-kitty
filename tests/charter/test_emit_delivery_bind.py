"""WP03 (#3488, FR-008) — bind the DRG-emit seam to the profile-delivery seam.

**C-004 context (verify-first — no shipped delivery code changed here).**
Grounding confirmed the rc1 #3488 delivery gaps are already fixed on current
main: operating-procedures is data-driven into the DRG
(``_emit_operating_procedure_edges``,
``src/doctrine/drg/migration/extractor.py``) with a fail-closed doctor check
(``_run_operating_procedures_check``,
``src/specify_cli/cli/commands/_doctrine_collect.py``); step ``description``
renders (``format_inline_named_body``,
``src/charter/context_renderers/profile_sections.py``); styleguide/toolguide
pointer-only delivery is a *documented, deliberate* NFR-001 token-budget
choice (``_STYLEGUIDE_TOOLGUIDE_POINTER_ONLY_REASON``, same module). The
residual this file closes is structural, not a code fix: no test previously
bound the DRG-emit side (a profile-selector field really is projected into
the graph) to the delivery side (that same channel reaches the agent, either
as an inline body or as an *attested* pointer-only fetch stanza). This file
binds ``_render_profile_sections``'s delivery renderer composition
(``_PROFILE_SECTION_RENDERERS``) to the projected-channel roster
(``_REAL_PROJECTED_CHANNELS``), so a renderer added without a matching
roster entry, or a rostered channel that stops delivering (neither body nor
attested pointer-only), reddens — plus a 3-edge emit spot-check
(``test_directive_tactic_operating_procedures_are_emitted_as_drg_edges``).
It additionally binds the emit-side governance scope-field table
(``_GOVERNANCE_PROFILE_SCOPE_FIELDS``) to the ``MissionTypeProfile`` schema
(the #3604 defect class: a ``selected_*`` field that validates and loads but
has no table entry to project it into the DRG). This is not a full,
automatic emit↔delivery cross-seam enumeration — a purely emit-only channel
that is projected into the DRG but never wired into any delivery renderer at
all stays outside what these binds catch.

**FR-008 anti-divergence test design.** The six profile-selector channels
``_render_profile_sections`` composes (its module-level
``_PROFILE_SECTION_RENDERERS`` tuple) are grouped into two buckets:

* **body-delivering** — ``directive`` (``directive-references`` →
  ``_render_profile_directives``), ``tactic`` (``tactic-references`` →
  ``_render_profile_tactics``), and ``operating-procedures`` (the
  ``collaboration.operating-procedures`` field → an
  ``agent_profile --requires--> procedure`` DRG edge → the profile channel →
  ``render_profile_procedures``). Each renders the artifact's verbatim body
  inline.
* **attested pointer-only** — ``styleguide`` / ``toolguide``
  (``styleguide-references`` / ``toolguide-references`` →
  ``render_profile_styleguides`` / ``render_profile_toolguides``, both
  ``body_fn=None`` by design), and ``suggested_doctrine`` (the profile
  *channel*'s ``suggests``-reached #3063 A–E families →
  ``render_profile_suggested_doctrine``, also ``body_fn=None`` — NFR-003:
  a suggested artefact is always named as a link, never inlined). Never an
  inline body; always the fetch stanza, and the *reason* for that choice is
  either a named, importable constant (styleguide/toolguide) or the
  renderer's own docstring (suggested_doctrine) rather than an unattested
  aside.

``test_directive_tactic_operating_procedures_are_emitted_as_drg_edges`` binds
the **emit** half: it runs the single-authority extractor
(``extract_artifact_edges``, mirroring the tmp_path pack-fixture pattern used
throughout ``tests/doctrine/drg/migration/test_extractor.py``) over a minimal
fixture pack and asserts the three body-delivering channels really do land as
``agent_profile --requires--> {directive,tactic,procedure}`` DRG edges — not
merely assumed from reading the source.

``test_real_projected_channels_are_delivered_or_attested_pointer_only`` binds
the **delivery** half: it renders one synthetic profile citing all six
channels through the real ``_render_profile_sections`` entry point and
classifies each channel's rendered output as ``"body"``, ``"pointer_only"``,
or ``"undelivered"`` (an inline body is present XOR the fetch-stanza selector
is present; anything else — neither, or ambiguously both — is a divergence).
The FR-008 invariant, ``_is_consistent``, accepts ``"body"`` outright and
accepts ``"pointer_only"`` only when the channel carries a non-empty attested
reason; ``"undelivered"`` is always a failure.

``test_real_projected_channels_roster_matches_product_renderer_composition``
closes the divergence this file was written to catch but originally left
open: it binds ``_REAL_PROJECTED_CHANNELS`` to
``_PROFILE_SECTION_RENDERERS`` — the exact tuple the product composes — by
renderer *function identity*, not by a hand-counted literal. A 7th channel
wired into that tuple without a matching roster entry now fails this
assertion instead of passing silently (the original defect: the roster had
only five hand-listed channels while the product already composed six,
and nothing tied the two together).

**Red-first proof.** The classifier and invariant are generic — they do not
special-case the six real channel names — so the two synthetic-channel tests
below (``test_synthetic_undelivered_channel_is_caught`` and
``test_synthetic_unattested_pointer_only_channel_is_caught``) exercise the
*same* ``_classify_delivery`` / ``_is_consistent`` pair against a fabricated
channel that mimics exactly what a future one-seam-only divergence would look
like: a channel projected into the DRG whose delivery renderer was either
never wired up (renders neither a body nor its own fetch stanza) or wired
``body_fn=None`` with no attestation (silent pointer-only, the pre-#3488-fix
defect class). Both synthetic cases fail the invariant; the six real
channels, exercised through the identical mechanism in the test just above,
currently pass — proving the check is live, not a tautology.

    check with no structural tie to the delivery roster

    roster's direct-citation set could drift from what
    ``extract_artifact_edges`` actually emits, and nothing here would
    notice. This test drives the same fixture-and-assert shape generically
    off ``_ProjectedChannel.emitted_requires_edge_kind`` instead, so it is
    a genuine enumeration bind rather than three independent literals:

    * A channel present in the roster with a non-``None``
      ``emitted_requires_edge_kind`` whose edge stops being emitted (an
      **delivered-but-unemitted** regression) fails the per-channel assert
      below.
    * A channel added to the roster's direct-citation set without a
      matching real edge in the fixture also fails, the same way.

    The `emitted_requires_edge_kind is not None` filter is itself asserted
    against the three known direct-citation channels so silently dropping a
    channel from that set (or expanding it without updating this test's own
    understanding) reddens too, rather than only shrinking the loop body.

    ``styleguide``/``toolguide`` (profile-field-only delivery, no DRG edge)
    and ``suggested_doctrine`` (transitive ``suggests``-reachability, not a
    direct citation edge) are deliberately excluded -- see
