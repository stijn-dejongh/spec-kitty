"""FS-free identity-resolution leg (mission-resolver-port-01KX1C05 WP03, NFR-001).

Drives the shell's identity-resolution leg — the canonicalizer chain in
``specify_cli.missions._read_path_resolver`` (``resolve_handle_to_read_path``,
the guarded read-side seam :func:`mission_runtime._resolve_mission_slug` calls
FIRST, before any other fragment assembly) down to the single walk
(``specify_cli.context.mission_resolver.resolve_mission``) — with an injected
``FakeMissionResolver`` and **no** ``kitty-specs/`` tree on disk at all. This is
the concrete #1619 unblock: a caller can drive the trunk's handle→mission walk
against an in-memory fixture, with zero filesystem dependency on a materialized
mission directory.

Why ``resolve_handle_to_read_path`` and not the higher-level shell entry points
(``resolve_action_context`` / ``mission_context_for`` / ``resolve_placement_only``)
directly: each of those three gates the canonicalizer's answer behind a
``candidate_dir.exists()`` check before trusting it as the resolved
``mission_slug`` — a **pre-existing**, deliberate production behaviour (a
canonicalized identity is only adopted once something is actually on disk for
it), not something WP03 introduces or should bypass. Driving them end-to-end
therefore always needs a real directory on disk, which is exactly what NFR-001
scopes OUT of this test ("no kitty-specs/ tree present"). The seam this test
drives instead — ``resolve_handle_to_read_path`` with ``require_exists=False``
(the default) — is the same function :func:`mission_runtime._resolve_mission_slug`
calls, one level down: it returns the CANONICAL resolved directory computed via
the injected resolver's answer even when nothing backs it on disk yet, which is
precisely the identity-resolution leg NFR-001 asks to prove FS-free.

Scope (NFR-001, deliberately narrow): this test pins ONLY the identity leg —
resolving an operator handle (mid8 / full ULID / full slug) to its canonical
directory via the injected resolver. It does **not** drive the rest of
:func:`mission_runtime.resolve_action_context` (target-branch read, topology
read, status-surface read, workspace assembly) — those are separate,
still-FS-bound legs (``get_main_repo_root``, ``_resolve_coordination_branch``,
``_resolve_status_surface_dir``, topology) explicitly deferred to later #2173
phases per the WP03 design ruling (D-09).
