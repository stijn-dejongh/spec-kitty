"""Red-first partition-mapping tests for the artifacts port (WP02).

Mission ``coord-write-placement-closure-01KYCF83`` WP02 (FR-002, FR-003,
FR-006; DIRECTIVE_041 red-first). Pins, via BEHAVIORAL assertions on the
resolver (never literal dict snapshots -- an unrelated future addition to
either SSOT dict must not red this file), that:

- ``PRIMARY_METADATA`` now resolves a non-None, partition-aware
  ``commit_target`` (T006) instead of the old read-anchored ``None`` sentinel;
- ``decisions.events.jsonl`` and ``traces/`` classify to a COORD-partition kind
  via the SINGLE classifier ``kind_for_mission_file`` (T007/T008);
- ``assert_partition_invariant()`` stays exhaustive + disjoint after the two
  new classifications land (T009);
- ``write_meta`` -- driven the way a real caller derives its target from the
  port -- lands ``meta.json`` on the resolved PRIMARY surface, never an
  ambient decoy directory (T054), closing FR-002 at the foundation rather than
  deferring the first observation to WP09's birth-cutover seam.

Authored BEFORE the T006-T008 edits land: every assertion below reds against
the pre-edit classifier (``PRIMARY_METADATA.commit_target is None``;
``decisions.events.jsonl`` / ``traces/`` classify to ``None``) and goes green
only once T006-T008 are applied.
