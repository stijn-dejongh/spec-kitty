"""Red-first unit tests for the kind-aware write-side placement partition.

Mission ``write-surface-coherence-01KVTVZS`` WP01 (FR-001, FR-002, FR-004,
FR-010; DIRECTIVE_034 red-first).

The READ side has been kind-aware via :func:`artifact_home_for` since #2090; the
WRITE side (:func:`resolve_placement_only`) was kind-BLIND — it routed purely by
stored topology and returned the coordination ref for EVERY artifact under
coordination topology. WP01 re-partitions the planning + identity kinds onto the
primary ``target_branch`` for every topology shape and makes the write-side
projection consult the kind.

These tests pin the partition at the lowest level through the **pre-existing**
entry points (:func:`artifact_home_for` and :func:`resolve_placement_only`):

- a primary kind (``SPEC``) resolves to the primary surface / ``target_branch``
  even on a coordination-topology mission (the correctness change);
- a coord kind (``STATUS_STATE``) still resolves to the coordination branch;
- a flattened mission routes both kinds to ``target_branch`` (unchanged);
- ``resolve_placement_only`` requires the ``kind`` keyword — a no-kind call is a
  ``TypeError``, not a silent default (DECISION 1, the no-silent-flip contract).

Fixture data uses a real 26-char ULID ``mission_id`` and the derived 8-char
``mid8`` so the resolver exercises real-shaped identity, not a short fake slug.
