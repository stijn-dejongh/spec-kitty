"""Unit tests for phase-aware CONSOLIDATED resolution (WP03, T009-T013).

Mission ``post-merge-write-authoring-finish-01KYRRM5`` (FR-001/002/003,
C-001/002/003/005, NFR-001/004). Covers:

* E1 (CONSOLIDATED) — PRIMARY-kind and coord-kind resolution is BYTE-IDENTICAL
  to #3076 (no behaviour change on this leg, per the ADR).
* E2 (PUBLISHED), content present — the in-scope kinds (PRIMARY +
  ISSUE_MATRIX/TRACER_FILE/ACCEPTANCE_MATRIX) resolve to the resolved Primary
  Branch NAME, never a SHA or ``HEAD`` (paula MINOR-2), and the coordination-
  surface probe is bypassed entirely (so a fully-retired E2 mission whose
  coordination branch has ALSO been deleted does not raise
  ``CoordinationBranchDeleted`` — the #3033 T007 shape).
* E2, content absent — refuses (``ActionContextError``), never a fabricated
  write.
* The squash case (D1, priti m3) — content-presence succeeds where an
  ancestry-based check (``git merge-base --is-ancestor``) would
  false-negative; this test PINS that rejection.
* SC-005 — ``STATUS_STATE`` / ``DECISION_LOG`` resolution via
  ``resolve_artifact_surface`` is UNCHANGED in PRE_CONSOLIDATION and E2 (not
  re-routed to CONSOLIDATED) — the shared-resolver non-regression guarantee.
* Renata M1 — both ``resolve_placement_only`` (probe) and
  ``resolve_artifact_surface`` (materializer) derive the SAME
  :class:`~mission_runtime.lifecycle_phase.LifecyclePhase` for one mission
  state (no split-brain, NFR-001).

Fixtures build REAL git repos through the actual merge-time bookkeeping entry
point (:func:`specify_cli.consolidation.baseline.record_baseline_merge_commit`),
mirroring ``tests/specify_cli/cli/commands/test_issue_3033_post_consolidation_write.py``
(WP02) and ``tests/mission_runtime/test_lifecycle_phase.py`` (WP03 T008).
