"""coord-read-fail-closed-01M38VVH WP04 (FR-004 / NFR-002) — caller blast-radius.

WP01 made a coord-partition ``read_dir`` on ``CoordState.UNMATERIALIZED`` raise
``CoordinationWorktreeUnmaterialized`` instead of silently substituting the
empty PRIMARY checkout (see ``test_coord_read_seam.py``). That flips ~25
no-catch coord ``STATUS_STATE`` readers from silent-wrong-data to fail-loud —
the *desired* outcome — but each caller must land at a sane, operator-facing
boundary (the sibling's ``next_step``), never a raw/opaque traceback.

This module pins three things (Phase-0 audit in ``research.md`` §blast-radius):

* **T012** — the two SANCTIONED read-only degraders
  (``mission_runtime.read_dir_degrade.resolve_read_dir_or_degrade`` and
  ``review.cycle._review_cycle_wp_dir(kind=REVIEW_CYCLE)``) still degrade: their
  ``except (..., StatusReadPathNotFound)`` absorbs the new sibling unchanged
  (NFR-002 no-regression). A representative ALREADY-SAFE catcher
  (``status.aggregate.MissionStatus.load``) is unaffected because it resolves
  through a completely different, untouched resolver
  (``missions._read_path_resolver.resolve_surface_dir_or_typed_error``), not
  the ``mission_runtime.resolution`` seam WP01 changed.
* **T013** — three of the four named no-catch readers
  (``decisions.emit._mission_dir``, ``agent_utils.status.build_kanban_status``,
  ``lanes.recovery.scan_recovery_state``) already land at a sane boundary: the
  reader's own code does nothing between the seam call and its return/raise
  that could replace the well-formed ``CoordinationWorktreeUnmaterialized``
  (informative ``next_step``, distinct ``error_code``) with a less-informative
  exception. The fourth
  (``agent_tasks_ports.RealCoordCommitRouter.feature_write_dir:339``) is
  verified NOT REACHABLE with the new sibling at all — its seam-calling arm
  requires ``MissionTopology.SINGLE_BRANCH`` (an existing, unrelated
  ``ActionContextError`` gate), which structurally never has an UNMATERIALIZED
  coordination branch; its other arm resolves through a completely different,
  untouched resolver. No caller edit was needed in any of the four owned
  readers.
* **T014** — the SAME four readers produce NO new raise on a non-coord
  (SINGLE_BRANCH) mission — the seam change is scoped to coord-partition reads
  only (regression pin).

Real-git fixtures reuse the golden-path scaffolding verbatim (do NOT duplicate
the git/mission-creation primitives) — same pattern as
``test_coord_read_seam.py``.
