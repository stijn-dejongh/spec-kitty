"""WP05 / FR-008 — behavioral class-closing guard for INV-COORD-ROLLBACK (#2786 + #2367-B).

INV-COORD-ROLLBACK (data-model): *after any merge rollback, either the
coordination branch is coherent (no WP from this merge's write-set still reduces
to ``DONE`` on the committed coord ref while its lane rolled back to
``approved``) OR a ``pending_coord_reconcile`` marker names the stranded WP(s).*
No rollback path may leave a stranded committed ``done`` **and** marker-absent.

The invariant is **behavioral**, so this guard is behavioral — NOT a source grep
for the mark call. Two complementary halves close the whole defect class:

* **T015 — behavioral falsifier (non-vacuity).** The SAME invariant assertion
  (:func:`_assert_coord_rollback_invariant`) is driven against a REAL bake-path
  strand. With the real mark in place it is GREEN (the strand is marked, so the
  committed/working split-brain is recoverable). When
  ``_persist_coord_reconcile_marker`` / ``coord_incoherent_done_wps`` is
  monkeypatched to a runtime no-op and the same real strand is re-driven, the
  guard REDS (``strand-on-committed-ref ∧ marker-absent``). A guard that stayed
  green under a runtime-stubbed mark would be a tautology and is rejected — these
  ``pytest.raises(AssertionError)`` tests prove it does not.

* **T016 — programmatic restore-site enumeration + topology-gating.** The seven
  ``_restore_final_bookkeeping_snapshots`` restore-shape sites are enumerated
  from the executor AST (never a hardcoded line-number list — they drift as
  helpers move). The class-closing structural invariant is that the ONLY raw
  ``_restore_final_bookkeeping_snapshots(`` call lives inside the marking
  primitive ``_restore_and_guard_coord_coherence`` — every other restore site
  routes through it, so a future un-routed restore site cannot strand silently.
  Site ≈691 is asserted dead-for-coord (inside ``if not
  run.done_marked_before_target:``) and site ≈701
  (``_project_status_bookkeeping_to_target`` failure) is asserted
  coord-reachable-and-routed — the live same-shape site the original six-site
  enumeration missed.

Behavioral harnesses (fixture bootstrap + bake-mid-write-set failure injection +
git-reducible committed/working readers) are REUSED verbatim from the WP01
red-first repro and the WP03 executor integration tests; this module never
re-authors them.
