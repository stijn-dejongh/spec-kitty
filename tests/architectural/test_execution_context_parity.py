"""e2e CWD-invariance ratchet — MissionExecutionContext parity gate.

Coverage (FR-023)
-----------------
This ratchet is the Strangler gate for the execution-state-domain-remediation
mission (#1619 / #1672 / execution-state-canonical-surface-01KTG6P9). It proves
**identical WP lane data and transition identity** for the full
``next → implement → move-task → review → status`` sequence across three
execution modes:

1. **main-checkout CWD** — commands driven from the repository root with a lane
   worktree already created (the conventional agent CWD during planning/review).
2. **lane-worktree CWD** — commands driven from the ``.worktrees/`` lane path
   (the conventional agent CWD during implementation).
3. **direct-to-target** — commands driven from the repository root with *no*
   worktree; the declared target branch is used directly and an unauthorized
   write to a mainline-protected branch is refused (C-001).

CI gate (FR-024)
----------------
This test is a required gate for PRs that touch any of the following paths
(via the ``execution_context`` path filter in ``.github/workflows/ci-quality.yml``):

* ``src/specify_cli/core/execution_context.py``
* ``src/specify_cli/status/**``
* ``src/runtime/next/**``
* ``src/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/**``
* ``tests/architectural/test_execution_context_parity.py``
* ``src/mission_runtime/**``  (added when the mission_runtime umbrella lands, WP02)

The ``integration-tests-core-misc`` CI job runs this file exclusively when
``execution_context``-only changes are detected, so status/runtime edits always
exercise the parity gate even when the wider core-misc suite is skipped.

Write-path extension (#1672 / FR-008)
-------------------------------------
``test_cwd_parity_write`` proves that a write transition driven via
``agent status emit`` produces an **identical deterministic event identity**
(``from_lane`` / ``to_lane`` / ``wp_id`` / ``actor``) and an **identical
resulting persisted lane** regardless of whether ``emit`` is invoked from the
main-checkout CWD or a lane-worktree CWD, and that the write lands in the
**main checkout's** event log in both cases.

``test_write_ratchet_catches_divergence`` is the anti-vacuity proof for the
write path.

Full-sequence extension (execution-state-canonical-surface-01KTG6P9 / FR-020..022)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
``test_full_sequence_main_checkout_parity`` (T002) and
``test_full_sequence_worktree_parity`` (T003) drive WP01 through the complete
lane progression ``planned → claimed → in_progress → for_review → in_review``
via ``agent tasks move-task --no-auto-commit``, one from the main-checkout CWD
and the other from the lane-worktree CWD.  The ratchet asserts that:

* the **resolved WP identity** (``wp_id`` / ``from_lane`` / ``to_lane`` in each
  transition) is identical across both CWDs, and
* the **final persisted lane** (from ``agent tasks status --json``) is identical.

``test_full_sequence_direct_to_target`` (T004) drives the same sequence from
the main-checkout CWD with *no* worktree present, verifying direct-to-target
mode.  It also asserts that ``agent status emit`` targeting the ``main``
protected branch without ``SPEC_KITTY_TEST_MODE`` is **refused** (C-001).

``test_full_sequence_ratchet_catches_divergence`` (T005) is the non-vacuity
proof: it injects a divergent status transition in the worktree-local event
log and asserts the two independent read paths diverge, proving the full-
sequence ratchet would catch a real CWD-routing regression.

Design principles
-----------------
* Uses ``subprocess`` with explicit ``cwd=`` — NEVER ``os.chdir()`` which
  mutates global process state.
* Uses minimal hand-crafted fixtures (git init + JSONL bootstrap) rather than
  invoking the full ``spec-kitty init`` / ``finalize-tasks`` pipeline to keep
  fixture setup fast and hermetic.
* The fixture creates a real git worktree so that ``find_repo_root()`` resolves
  correctly from both the main checkout and the worktree path.
* The injection proofs verify that the ratchet is not vacuously passing by
  deliberately corrupting the status in one location and asserting divergence.
* ``--no-auto-commit`` is passed to ``move-task`` throughout the full-sequence
  tests so the fixture does not need to commit on a specific branch — the
  ratchet tests CWD-invariant status-event routing, not the commit flow.

Markers
-------
``architectural`` — this is an architectural invariant (CWD-invariance).
``git_repo`` — required because the fixture calls ``git init`` and
``git worktree add`` via subprocess (Rule 1 from test_pytest_marker_correctness).
``non_sandbox`` — the fixture spawns ``git worktree add`` and invokes
``spec-kitty`` as a subprocess, both of which are structurally incompatible
with mutmut's forked sandbox.

Composite-fragment dual-CWD extension (execution-context-unification-01KTPKST / IC-08 / FR-011)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The block at the bottom of this module extends the ratchet from *string-keyed
status parity* (above) to **fragment-by-fragment parity of the resolved
``MissionExecutionContext``** — the doc-09 fragment / op-composite described in
``kitty-specs/execution-context-unification-01KTPKST/data-model.md``. It is
authored **ATDD-first** (charter C-011): the fragment assertions are written
RED now, *before* the fragments exist on ``mission_runtime.MissionExecutionContext``,
and each converges to GREEN as its conversion WP lands.

The harness resolves the context twice — once with ``repo_root`` derived (via
``find_repo_root``) from the **primary-checkout CWD** and once from the
**lane-worktree CWD** — and asserts the two resolved contexts are equal,
fragment by fragment, for every lifecycle action that the resolver supports
today (``tasks`` / ``tasks_finalize`` / ``accept``). The broader lifecycle
(``specify``/``plan``/``analyze``/``status``) and the fragment objects
themselves (Identity incl. ``mid8``; BranchRef incl. ``target_branch`` +
``destination_ref``/``CommitTarget``; StatusSurface; Workspace incl.
``primary_root``; ArtifactPlacement; PromptSource) do not exist on the context
yet, so the assertions that depend on them are ``xfail(strict=True)``.

xfail → convergence-WP map (IC-08 / T003)
-----------------------------------------
Each ``xfail(strict=True)`` test below converges (flips to XPASS, at which point
the converging WP removes the marker) as its conversion lands. ``strict=True``
means a stale marker left after a fragment lands fails the suite, forcing the
converging WP to delete it — that is the ratchet.

==================================  ====  ==========================================

Live (non-xfail) parity coverage
---------------------------------
``test_dual_cwd_existing_field_parity`` asserts CWD-invariance of the fields
that the resolver already populates today (``mission_slug`` / ``target_branch``
/ ``feature_dir`` / ``detection_method``). It guards against a CWD-routing
regression in the *current* surface and is the anchor the fragment tests grow on
top of — it must stay GREEN throughout the conversion.

Determinism (NFR-003)
---------------------
The composite-fragment block reuses the same hand-crafted, network-free,
clock-free fixtures as the status-parity block. ``repo_root`` is derived via
``find_repo_root`` from each CWD (no ``os.chdir``); no wall-clock, ULID-mint, or
random value influences any asserted fragment. The resolver is called in-process
with explicit ``repo_root``/``cwd`` arguments, so results are reproducible across
both CWDs and across repeated runs. The synthetic flattened mission is torn down
(``shutil.rmtree`` of the temp tree) by ``tmp_path`` so it never leaks a
``test-feature-*`` mission or a ``kitty/mission-test-feature-*`` branch.

def test_ratchet_catches_divergence(tmp_path: Path) -> None:
    """Injection proof: the ratchet FAILS when CWD-parity is genuinely broken.

    This test constructs a scenario where the main-checkout CWD and the
    worktree CWD point to *different* ``status.events.jsonl`` files with
    deliberately different WP lane data. The status command will read
    different files for each CWD, so the lane outputs diverge.

    The purpose is to prove the ratchet is not vacuously green: if CWD routing
    were broken, ``test_cwd_parity`` would catch it.

    Test structure:
    1. Build a repo with a worktree (same as parity_repo fixture).
    2. Add a *second* status event to the worktree's copy of status.events.jsonl
       that transitions WP01 to ``in_progress``.
    3. The main checkout still has WP01 as ``planned``.
    4. Read status from both CWDs, assert that the lanes differ.
       If they are the same, the read path is not CWD-sensitive (the invariant
       we are testing) and something is wrong with the test design.

    Note: under the *current* implementation, both CWDs resolve to the SAME
    status file (the main checkout), so adding events only in the worktree copy
    is the correct way to simulate divergence: we write divergent data to the
    worktree path and then verify that the reads do NOT collapse them (because
    the current implementation reads from the single primary checkout, not from
    the worktree).

    What this test really proves
    ----------------------------
    The test demonstrates the CWD-variant scenario that existed prior to
    issue #1619: if a future regression causes the worktree CWD invocation to
    read from *the worktree's kitty-specs/* instead of the primary checkout,
    the lanes would diverge and ``test_cwd_parity`` above would fail.
    This injection proof constructs exactly that scenario explicitly, without
    relying on a real regression, to validate that the ratchet design is sound.

#    remained after D-12 adoption); the test was retired with it.

# AC10 — Canonical status-read ratchet (FR-008e / FR-009 / #1735, WP05 of
# coordination-merge-stabilization-01KTXRVR)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# WP05 routed the last two Class A read stragglers — the retrospective
# completion gate (``retrospective/gate.py``) and the retrospect command
# surface (``cli/commands/agent_retrospect.py``) — through the canonical
# ``resolve_status_surface``. Under coordination topology the authoritative
# ``status.events.jsonl`` lives in the coordination worktree; a
# ``feature_dir``-anchored direct read in these modules is exactly the #1735
# split-brain bug class.
#
# This ratchet EXTENDS the static-gate convention above (C-005: extend, never
# fork) with an AST scan scoped to the two known read families in the two
# fixed modules (research/risks: a tree-wide ``feature_dir`` scan has dozens
# of legitimate hits on already-resolved surfaces, so the scope is the two
# modules whose reads were routed):
#
# 1. ``read_events(<…feature_dir…>)`` — a feature_dir-anchored event read.
# 2. ``<…feature_dir…> / "status.events.jsonl"`` — a direct event-log path
#    composition.
#
# The only exempt locations are the routed seam helpers themselves
# (``_resolve_events_path`` / ``_canonical_events_dir``), whose legacy-mission
# fallback composes the path AFTER first consulting the canonical resolver.
# The ratchet additionally asserts each seam exists and calls
# ``resolve_status_surface``, so deleting a seam (e.g. by reverting WP05's
# T024/T025 routing) turns this test RED — the anti-vacuity property.
