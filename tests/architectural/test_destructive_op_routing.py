"""Unification routing gate (mission ``merge-destructive-op-safety-01M2XQF8``,
WP05/T018-T020, NFR-006/FR-007, ``contracts/routing-invariant.md``).

A non-vacuous architectural gate (DIRECTIVE_043) proving the defect class this
mission fixes (a destructive git command run against dirty/off-target state)
is closed BY CONSTRUCTION, not by reviewer goodwill:

1. **T018 -- routing/allowlist gate.** Every ``git reset --hard``,
   user-facing ``git worktree remove ... --force``, ``git merge --abort``,
   and ``git stash push`` command LITERAL under ``src/specify_cli/`` is
   either (a) inside the WP01 guard's own implementation (``git/destructive_guard.py``,
   ``git/ref_advance.py``), (b) reached only via the shared
   ``guarded_worktree_remove`` chokepoint (proven separately -- those live
   call sites carry no raw literal at all, by construction), or (c) a member
   of the frozen, individually-rationalized ``_ALLOWLIST`` below. The census
   is LIVE (AST-driven, re-run every test run against the actual tree) --
   not a hand-copied snapshot -- and shrink-only: a site disappearing from
   source is a (non-failing) prompt to trim the allowlist; a NEW raw literal
   outside both the guard and the allowlist fails the gate.
2. **T019 -- no new parallel dirty predicate.** The guard reuses
   ``ref_advance._dirty_entries`` (data-model.md); this asserts no NEW
   module-level ``git status --porcelain``-parsing "is dirty" predicate was
   introduced in the ``git``/``merge``/``coordination``/``core/vcs`` seams
   beyond the pre-existing, curated baseline.
3. **T020 -- self-mutation (non-vacuity).** Both scans are proven to
   actually bite: a planted, un-rationalized destructive-command literal (or
   a planted new dirty predicate) is detected by the SAME scanner the primary
   gates use, and separately, temporarily dropping one real entry from each
   frozen baseline reproduces the exact failure the primary gate would raise
   for a genuine regression -- proving the diff logic itself is not vacuous.

``git stash push`` census (user-content-preservation epic #4915, finding #1
of #4946, folded into PR #4936): PR #4936's #4888 fix already removed
``git stash push --staged`` / ``git stash pop --index`` from
``git/commit_helpers.py::safe_commit``, but nothing censused ``git stash``
argv literals repo-wide, and two dead helpers (``core/vcs/git.py::git_stash``
/ ``git_stash_pop``) still carried the footgun argv with no production
caller. Those helpers are deleted (mission ``fold-4946-stash-gate``); this
gate now censuses ``("stash", "push")`` the same way it censuses the other
three destructive patterns, so a FUTURE reintroduction of a raw
hide-then-restore stash call is caught here rather than relying on review.
The live census currently finds zero ``("stash", "push")`` argv literals
under ``src/specify_cli/``, so no ``_ALLOWLIST`` entry is needed.

Detection strategy
-------------------
A bare text ``grep`` for ``"reset", "--hard"`` would miss the one real
indirection this codebase has (``coordination/workspace.py``'s
``_GIT_WORKTREE = "worktree"`` module constant, used in place of the string
literal at the one intentionally-guard-exempt call site). This gate instead
walks every ``ast.List``/``ast.Tuple`` literal, resolves each element that is
either a string constant or a `Name` bound to a module-level string constant,
and matches an ORDERED (not necessarily contiguous) subsequence of the
target command's tokens -- so ``[..., _GIT_WORKTREE, "remove", "--force",
...]`` is caught exactly like the literal spelling.

Known, out-of-band scope note (C-004 follow-up, NOT this gate's job)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A separate, deferred loss surface -- standalone ``git branch -D`` deleting an
unmerged branch's commits (``merge/executor.py``, ``orchestrator_api/``,
``core/mission_creation.py``) -- needs its own is-branch-merged guard. It is
a distinct command family from the three NFR-006 names and is intentionally
out of this gate's scope; tracked as a follow-up mission in the WP05 PR body.
