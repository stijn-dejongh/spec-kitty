"""TOML shape assertions for the shared-package boundary cutover.

These tests enforce the pyproject-level constraints documented in
``kitty-specs/shared-package-boundary-cutover-01KQ22DS/spec.md``:

* **R4 / C-004**: ``[project.dependencies]`` MUST NOT exact-pin
  (``==X.Y.Z``) the shared packages ``spec-kitty-events`` or
  ``spec-kitty-tracker``. Exact pins live in ``uv.lock``; pyproject uses
  compatible ranges (``>=X.Y,<X+1``) so downstream consumers can roll
  forward without coordinated CLI releases.

* **R5 / C-005**: ``[tool.uv.sources]`` MUST NOT contain a ``path`` or
  ``editable`` entry for any of ``spec-kitty-events``,
  ``spec-kitty-tracker``, or ``spec-kitty-runtime``. Editable / path
  sources belong in developer-only configuration (e.g. ``uv.toml``
  overrides), never in the committed pyproject -- see ADR notes in
  ``contracts/events_consumer_surface.md``.

* **R6 / FR-006**: ``[project.dependencies]`` MUST NOT list
  ``spec-kitty-runtime``. The runtime PyPI surface is retired in this
  mission; the internalized runtime under
  ``src/runtime/next/_internal_runtime/`` is the only authoritative
  source.

These tests are TOML-shape assertions that run independently of the
import-graph rules in ``test_shared_package_boundary.py``.

NFR-006 caps total architectural-test runtime at ≤30 seconds; these tests
parse a single TOML file and run in milliseconds.

WP08 (``Cut over pyproject metadata``) lands the pyproject changes that
satisfy R4, R5, and R6. Until then, the live assertions are
``xfail``-marked with a clear reason. WP08's subtask T030 explicitly
removes those markers as part of its acceptance criteria.
