"""Architectural surface test for the ``mission_runtime`` umbrella (FR-005).

``mission_runtime`` is the canonical execution-state surface. Consumers import
**only** from the package root (``from mission_runtime import ...``); the
internal submodules ``mission_runtime.context`` and ``mission_runtime.resolution``
are import-forbidden from outside the package. This keeps the public surface lean
and prevents the internal-leakage that let the old ``core/execution_context``
resolver sprawl.

Rules enforced:
* **MR-1** (pytestarch): No module outside ``mission_runtime`` imports any
  ``mission_runtime.*`` submodule directly.
* **MR-2** (AST scan): Same rule for lazy / function-scoped imports that
  pytestarch's import-graph analysis may miss, scanned across the whole source
  tree (the umbrella's surface must be enforced repo-wide, not scoped).
* **MR-3** (injection proof): The AST scanner is not a no-op — it actively
  catches an injected violation.
