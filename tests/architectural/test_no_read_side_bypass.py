"""Structural read-side gate — no read-side placement-seam bypass (WP08 / IC-06).

read-side-placement-seam-migration-01KYHP67, FR-005 / FR-006 / NFR-003 /
NFR-004: the CAPSTONE structural gate over the read-bypass primitives this
mission censused — mirroring the write-side structural gate
(``test_no_write_side_rederivation.py``'s
``test_adopted_and_residual_modules_have_no_checkout_derived_commit_target``
whole-tree AST scan). This is NOT modeled on the *behavioral*
``test_read_surface_placement_guard.py`` — it is the symmetric structural
analog of the write gate.

read-side-seam-primary-primitive-closure-01KYKMMT, WP02 (FR-012): the censused
callee set grew **2 → 4** here — ``resolve_feature_dir_for_mission`` (the one
resolver no prior gate covered, #3014) and ``primary_feature_dir_for_mission``
(which inherits the guarantee transferred from WP01's retired use-count
floors) join the original two. Growing the census makes the 34 real
``primary_feature_dir_for_mission`` call sites -- minus the 3 newly sanctioned
FR-005 foundation sites (31 remain), plus the one newly-classified
``migrate-fail-loud`` ``resolve_feature_dir_for_mission`` site (32 total) --
**expected red** until a later WP routes them. That red is this mission's
acceptance signal (US8 / FR-023), not a defect.

Post-merge aggregate-squad closeout (fix/read-side-seam-primary-primitive-
closure follow-up, cross-lane integration lens): the censused callee set grew
**4 → 5** here — ``_compose_primary_feature_dir``, the module-private leaf
WP03 extracted and WP08 re-pointed the deleted public wrapper's foundation
callers onto, joins the four above. Before this closeout the leaf was censused
ONLY via ``_LEAF_PRIMITIVE_ALIASES`` bookkeeping, never a member of
``_TARGET_CALLEE_NAMES`` itself, so the gate enforced the deleted wrapper's
*dead name* (zero live call sites, permanently) while the *live leaf* carried
no census entry at all -- a module outside the five named foundation sites
could import it directly and call it with a canonical handle, reopening the
exact canonical-handle + caller-chosen-partition bypass this mission exists to
end, invisibly to this gate. See ``docs/development/read-side-seam-classification.md``'s
"Post-merge closeout" section for the full record.

Scope of the guarantee (honest bounds — do NOT overstate)
----------------------------------------------------------
This gate makes a new call to **any of the five ledger-censused primitives**
un-addable outside the sanctioned + allow-listed sets. It does NOT make every
conceivable read-side bypass "unrepresentable":

- **Covered**: bare-``Name`` calls, ``Attribute.attr`` calls (``mod.symbol(...)``),
  and **import-aliased** calls (``from ... import X as _alias`` → ``_alias(...)``),
  which ``_import_alias_map`` resolves back to the origin symbol.
- **Known gap — ``resolve_feature_dir_for_slug``**: a zero-call-site latent
  sibling in the same module. Not censused (nothing to census); importing it
  anywhere would silently re-open the gap this gate closes for its siblings.
  See the ledger's "Known gap" section.
- **Known gap — wrapper laundering**: ``resolve_subtasks_gate_dir`` wraps a
  censused primitive behind a pinned-kind call; a callee-name census cannot
  see through the wrapper. See the ledger's "Known gap" section.
- **Known gap — local rebinding**: ``_alias = candidate_feature_dir_for_mission``
  followed by ``_alias(...)`` is value-flow, not import aliasing, and is not
  resolved.

Contract: ``kitty-specs/read-side-placement-seam-migration-01KYHP67/
contracts/read-side-gate.md`` and ``kitty-specs/
read-side-seam-primary-primitive-closure-01KYKMMT/contracts/ledger-grammar.md``
/ ``gate-extension.md``.

Scope (NFR-003 — reuse, never fork the walk)
---------------------------------------------
Reuses ``tests.architectural._placement_whole_tree_scan.scan_scope()`` — the
SAME shared whole-tree ``src/`` walker + write-side sanctioned-module filter
the write gate consumes (``test_read_and_write_gates_share_the_same_scan_scope``
below asserts identity, not mere equality, of the two gates' base scan
function). The read gate layers ONE additional, read-specific sanctioned-module
filter (``_READ_SANCTIONED_MODULES``) on top of that shared base — composing a
second filter is not forking the walk; ``_placement_whole_tree_scan`` itself
already composes ``BOUNDARY_SANCTIONED_MODULES`` and
``BOUNDARY_SANCTIONED_PREFIXES`` the same way.

Finding grammar
----------------
AST-based (``ast.Call``): flags any callee resolving to
``candidate_feature_dir_for_mission`` or ``resolve_planning_read_dir`` (bare
``Name``, ``Attribute.attr``, or an ``ImportFrom``/``Import`` alias resolved
back to its origin symbol). Callee identity IS the finding — reads have no
``ref`` argument to value-flow-trace, so no "seam-derived" discriminator is
needed (unlike the write gate's ``CommitTarget(ref=...)`` grammar). A
docstring/comment merely NAMING one of these symbols never becomes an
``ast.Call`` node and is therefore never flagged (the bite test below proves
this).

Allow-list (T018) — the ledger is the ONE authority, mechanically
------------------------------------------------------------------
``docs/development/read-side-seam-classification.md`` (WP02) is the single
authority for WHICH sites stay lenient and HOW MANY there are. This module
does not restate those numbers: it PARSES the ledger (``_ledger_summary_counts``
+ ``_ledger_stay_lenient_index``) and reconciles ``_ALLOW_LIST_SEED`` against
it, so editing the ledger's live-census Summary table or its machine-checked
stay-lenient index REDS this gate. ``_ALLOW_LIST_SEED`` contributes only the
per-site *content descriptors* (token substrings + condensed rationale) that
markdown cannot carry; its membership and cardinality are ledger-derived, not
independently declared. Content-descriptor allow-listing (``_ratchet_keys.resolve_descriptor``,
the SAME resolver WS1/WS2/WS3/checkout-grammar entries in the write gate use):
``(rel_path, qualname, token_substring)`` resolves LIVE to exactly one finding's
``(rel_path, qualname, token_line)`` composite key — never a bare path (C-003:
no file-scoped blanket exemptions). Shrink-only: a staleness twin-guard REDS
the moment a routed/removed entry stops resolving to its seeded key (FR-006 /
NFR-004) — the fix is to DELETE the stale entry, never leave a vacuous rule.

Per-site index discriminator (WP02 T009, G2) — ``primitive`` + ``site token``
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The stay-lenient index is keyed per **site**, not per function: a qualname can
carry SEVERAL censused sites of the SAME primitive
(``status/aggregate.py::MissionStatus._find_meta_path`` alone carries one
existing ``candidate_feature_dir_for_mission`` site plus three
newly-censused ``primary_feature_dir_for_mission`` sites — SC-015's
acceptance fixture, see ``test_index_discriminator_represents_a_four_site_qualname``
below). A trailing ``primitive`` column alone is NOT sufficient to address
this case: the three ``primary_feature_dir_for_mission`` sites inside that
one qualname would still collapse onto ONE ``(rel_path, qualname, primitive)``
key. ``_entry_primitive`` derives the ``primitive`` discriminator from each
entry's own ``token_substring`` (never restated as a separate hand-synced
field — the token substring already names its callee); a SECOND trailing
column, the site's own normalised ``token_substring`` verbatim, then
discriminates several same-primitive sites sharing one qualname (anchored on
qualname + normalised token, never a line number — DIRECTIVE_041). The
ledger's index table therefore gains a third AND a fourth trailing column
(``primitive``, ``site token`` — G1: both appended, never inserted) and the
membership/uniqueness checks below key on the resulting
``(rel_path, qualname, primitive, site_token)`` 4-tuple.

Foundation-site sanctions (WP02 T011, E3) — per-site, never a module blanket
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
``core/paths.py`` (×2) and ``core/git_ops.py`` (×1) call
``primary_feature_dir_for_mission`` from beneath the seam's own composition
root (NFR-009: routing them risks a resolution cycle). Neither module is
otherwise a sanctioned-infra module — both carry substantial unrelated logic
— so whole-module sanctioning would be exactly the path-scoped blanket C-003
forbids. ``_FOUNDATION_SANCTION_SEED`` sanctions these THREE sites
individually (the same content-descriptor mechanism as the allow-list, a
separate ledger-reconciled table so foundation-infra counts never blend into
the stay-lenient business-logic counts). The fourth named FR-005 foundation
site, ``coordination/surface_resolver.py``, is already a whole-module
sanctioned entry in ``_READ_SANCTIONED_MODULES`` (both primitives' calls there
are covered by the existing per-file rationale).

# T009 (G2, SC-015) — the index discriminator represents a four-site qualname.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


#: read-side-seam-primary-primitive-closure-01KYKMMT WP08 (T035/T039,
#: reconciliation item #3 from ``research/expected-reds.md``): a FROZEN
#: synthetic fixture, not a live scan of ``status/aggregate.py``. The test
#: used to scan that file directly, but its four-site shape (1
#: ``candidate_feature_dir_for_mission`` + 3 ``primary_feature_dir_for_mission``
#: calls, all inside ``MissionStatus._find_meta_path``) depended on the very
#: migration this ledger exists to drive to completion: WP07 routed two of
#: the three ``primary_feature_dir_for_mission`` sites through the seam, and
#: WP08 deleted the primitive outright and re-pointed the third (the
#: permanent canonicalizer fixture) at the module-private leaf -- so the live
#: file now carries ZERO ``primary_feature_dir_for_mission`` calls, and this
#: test's live-scan assumption cannot survive its own migration (WP07's own
#: handoff report flagged this gap and recommended exactly this fix: a frozen
#: synthetic source string, the same technique the module's other synthetic
#: fixtures already use elsewhere in this file). The synthetic source below
#: reproduces the acceptance shape the test needs -- one qualname, one
#: existing-primitive call, three same-primitive calls with distinct
#: arguments (so each normalises to a distinct token line) -- independent of
#: any real file's migration state.
