# Exemption mechanism -- `_is_self_write_only_diff`

<!-- Machine-readable exemption-registry row (R-014). Parsed by
     tests/architectural/test_exemption_registry_ratchet.py. ONE mechanism per
     file, so a retirement WP deletes ONLY its own row and never collides with a
     sibling retirement editing a shared file (squad-mandated design; the plan's
     stated reason for rejecting golden-count mode). The registry only SHRINKS:
     when a mechanism is retired onto the owner, its literal(s)/symbol vanish from
     src/ and the overcount / symbol-presence arm goes RED until this row file is
     deleted (red -> green per retirement). -->


- mechanism: `_is_self_write_only_diff`
- module: `src/specify_cli/cli/commands/implement_cores.py`
- literals: `_WP_SELF_WRITE_FILENAME_RE`
- symbol: `_is_self_write_only_diff`
- retirement-wp: `WP14`
- retirement-ref: `IC-07d`
- owner-route: `is_toolchain_generated_churn`
- status: `justified-survivor`

**WP14 (IC-07d) genuine must-keep, not a silent survivor.** The plan's IC-07d
retirement double-listed `_drop_vcs_lock_only_meta` and
`_drop_runtime_frontmatter_only_wp` as owner-routable (like their sibling
`_exclude_coord_owned`, which DOES route fully onto the owner-exposed
`is_status_state_path` leg -- its row was deleted, not replaced). Implementation
found the vcs-lock/frontmatter pair cannot make that same move: they are
structural twins of EACH OTHER (same "keep unless the predicate flags a
runtime self-write" shape, now merged into one `_drop_if`-consumed predicate),
but their filename gate is a `meta.json`/`WP##.md` DIFF comparison, not a
`MissionArtifactKind` classification -- `is_toolchain_generated_churn` answers
"is this file's *kind* toolchain-generated" (a whole-file verdict; `meta.json`
is unconditionally self-bookkeeping there, `WP##.md` is unconditionally
PRIMARY/never churn), while this predicate must answer "is THIS DIFF only the
runtime's own claim-time self-write", which requires reading both the working
tree and the committed baseline and comparing the changed keys/body. Forcing
the owner's kind-based verdict in here would either (a) always-drop `meta.json`
regardless of content -- silently swallowing a genuine non-lock operator edit,
regressing `test_non_lock_dirty_meta_still_blocks_auto_commit_false_claim` -- or
(b) never drop `WP##.md` at all (it is never toolchain-generated churn by
kind), regressing every runtime-frontmatter-only-diff test. Both are C6
violations. Registered here -- with real justification prose, `status:
justified-survivor`, and a live `_is_self_write_only_diff` symbol -- rather
than silently retained, per plan.md's "if implementation finds a genuine
must-keep, it becomes an explicit, justified registry row, never a silent
survivor" (WP15 precedent).
