"""Architectural guardrail (T013, C-002/NFR-001): no parallel lineage resolver.

``charter.org_extends.resolve_extends_order`` is the single canonical
resolver for lineage-chain topology (cycle detection, missing-base
detection, base-first ordering). ``src/specify_cli/doctrine/pack_lineage.py``
adapts ``pack_id``-keyed edges into the name-keyed shape that resolver
already consumes (see that module's docstring) -- it must never grow its own
graph-walking logic.

This guard AST-scans every ``pack_*.py`` module under
``src/specify_cli/doctrine/`` (the pack-module surface pack_lineage.py
belongs to) for two things:

1. **Positive**: ``pack_lineage.py`` actually calls
   ``resolve_extends_order`` -- lineage resolution genuinely routes through
   the canonical resolver, not just "doesn't do anything else".
2. **Negative**: no scanned module defines an *order-producing traversal* of
   its own -- structurally, a function that walks a chain (a ``while`` loop
   or self-recursion accumulating results via ``.append``/``.insert``)
   without delegating to ``resolve_extends_order``. That is exactly the
   shape of the retired ``org_charter._resolve_chain`` walker this mission
   forbids reintroducing (see ``org_extends.py``'s own module docstring,
   C-005/R-10).

Falsifiability (non-vacuousness): the guard is proven to actually
discriminate by injecting a fake second walker into a fixture source below
and confirming the scan flags it (``test_guard_flags_injected_second_walker``).
A fixture with an equivalent-looking loop that *does* delegate to
``resolve_extends_order`` is confirmed NOT flagged, so the guard isn't so
broad it would reject legitimate adapter code (``pack_lineage.py`` itself
included).
