"""SC-013 / FR-013 / NFR-005: nothing is uncollectable on a push to ``main``.

Issue `#2957 <https://github.com/Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty/issues/2957>`_. Four
frozen-contract test files broke on ``main`` and ``main`` stayed quiet, because
the only jobs that collect them — ``fast-tests-cli`` / ``integration-tests-cli``
— are gated on ``needs.changes.outputs.cli == 'true'``, and the ``cli`` filter
covers only ``src/specify_cli/cli/**``, ``tests/cli/**`` and
``tests/specify_cli/cli/**``. A push whose diff misses those paths skips all
three ``cli``-gated jobs, so their reds are not merely unnoticed — they are
structurally uncollectable.

**This is WP01's defect one layer up.** A frozen-contract test that no
main-branch job collects is exactly as inert as a schema slot nothing produces.

WHAT THIS MODULE ASSERTS (the amended SC-013). Not "the union of job selections
equals the full collection" — that is only satisfiable by dismantling the dorny
topology, which roughly seventeen invariants across ``tests/architectural/``
pin. It asserts the property that actually matters:

    every collected test NODE is selected by >= 1 job that RUNS on a push to
    ``main`` — on the GREEN PATH — evaluated with the real per-job selectors
    under the worst reachable filter state.

*Node*, not file. A file with one ``slow`` test and twenty ``fast`` ones
satisfies a file-level reading while the twenty never execute, and three of
#2957's four files are exactly that shape.

*Green path*, and the qualifier is load-bearing. The model has exactly one
deliberate fail-open term: ``needs.<job>.result == 'success'`` decides ``True``
(:data:`tests.architectural._gate_coverage._NEEDS_RESULT_RE_CONJUNCT`), because
reading it as unsatisfiable would declare every downstream job dead and make the
whole model useless. So a run in which an upstream job FAILS skips its dependents
and really does collect less than this gate assumes — correct GitHub behaviour,
and a different question from completeness. The practical consequence: an
uncollected count from this model is exact on a green run and a LOWER BOUND on a
red one.

THE MODEL IS BASELINE-FREE (deliberate, and checked below). The sibling ratchet
``test_gate_coverage.py`` freezes today's orphan surface in
``_gate_coverage_baseline.json`` and its own failure message ends "regenerate
the baseline with ``--update-baseline``". Bolting gating-awareness onto that
ratchet would have produced a four-figure orphan list plus one documented
command that erases it. This gate therefore reads no baseline, owns no
allowlist, and has no regeneration path: the only way to make it green is to
make a job collect the test.

WHY THE WORST-CASE FILTER STATE, AND WHY ONE EVALUATION SUFFICES. See
:func:`tests.architectural._gate_coverage.main_push_active_jobs` — the
"no group matched" state is reachable (a push touching only an unclaimed
``tests/**`` directory), and a job ``if:`` is monotone in the active-group set,
so completeness there implies completeness everywhere richer.

COST. One whole-tree ``--collect-only`` (~50 s, module-scoped, the same pass
five sibling arch guards already take) and an in-process, sub-second gate
simulation over it. No subprocess per job.
