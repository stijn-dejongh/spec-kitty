"""Architectural boundary tests for the ``specify_cli.status`` facade.

These tests enforce that no module *outside* ``specify_cli.status`` imports
any ``specify_cli.status.*`` submodule directly.  External consumers must go
through the curated public API surface defined by ``specify_cli.status.__all__``.

Rules enforced:
* **SR-1** (pytestarch): regression-lock on the 6 WP03-owned packages
  (agent_utils, lanes, post_merge, missions, merge, next). These are fully
  clean; SR-1 asserts they never reintroduce a static ``specify_cli.status.*``
  submodule import. It is intentionally *scoped to those packages*, not the
  whole tree — the repo-wide gate is SR-2.
* **SR-2** (AST scan): the **repo-wide** gate. No module across all of
  ``src/specify_cli`` and ``src/runtime`` may import any ``specify_cli.status.*``
  submodule (module-level *or* lazy/function-scoped, which pytestarch's
  import-graph analysis may miss), except the explicitly exempted plumbing /
  cycle-breaker files in ``_ALL_EXEMPT_FILES``.
* **SR-3** (injection proof): The AST scanner is not a no-op — it actively
  catches violations.

WP09 widened the enforced scope from WP03's 6-directory regression-lock to ALL
of ``src/specify_cli`` and ``src/runtime`` — but that repo-wide enforcement
lives in **SR-2**, not SR-1. SR-1 remains the focused regression-lock on the 6
already-clean packages.

Exemptions (C-004 plumbing — permanent):
  - ``coordination/status_transition.py``: internal Mission Management plumbing;
    it IS part of the transactional commit pipeline, not an external caller.
  - ``coordination/transaction.py``: BookkeepingTransaction plumbing.

Residual allow-list (post-WP10):
  WP10 routed every prior ROUTE-deferred file onto the ``status`` facade by
  promoting the relevant symbols into ``status/__init__.__all__``
  (lifecycle_events, work_package_lifecycle, reducer.materialize_snapshot,
  doctor.run_doctor, aggregate.InvalidMissionSlug) and refactoring the sync
  SaaS fan-out handler onto facade helpers. The only remaining entry is the
  permanent import-time cycle-breaker:
  - ``workspace/context.py`` — ``status.wp_metadata``
    (cycle-breaker: status/__init__ → .emit → workspace → .context; facade
    is not yet initialized when workspace.context loads at import time —
    permanent).
