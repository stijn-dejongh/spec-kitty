"""WP05 — class-closing guards for #2709 (FR-008 / SC-005).

Two NON-VACUOUS architectural lints that close the "merge silently overwrites
target-newer canonical state" defect class *by construction*, covering BOTH loss
mechanisms — NOT a re-run of the WP01 outcome repro. Precedent for the AST /
per-registry lint home: ``tests/architectural/test_merge_pipeline_ratchets.py``.

* **T012 — no-blind-copy AST lint** over the ``merge/`` projection path. The
  FR-005 regression is ``consolidation/bookkeeping_projection.py`` blind-``write_bytes``-ing
  a *foreign* status/meta/trace source straight onto the *authoritative*
  target-surface artifact (event log / ``meta.json`` / ``traces/*.md``) instead of
  reconciling it (``_union_event_logs`` / rematerialize). The lint fires on that
  exact shape and stays silent on the fixed tree — including the deliberately
  *derived* ``status.json`` copy (line ``write_bytes(source_status_bytes)``), which
  is a rematerialized/degenerate view, not an authoritative both-sides-divergent
  artifact.

* **T013 — driver-registry-completeness lint** (the primary #2709 ``-X theirs``
  vector, blind to the projection lint). Two independent assertions:
    - **sync**: every driver DECLARED in the in-code registry
      (``specify_cli.lanes.consolidation._MERGE_DRIVERS``) is REGISTERED in root
      ``.gitattributes`` and vice-versa — catches *dropping* an existing
      ``.gitattributes`` driver line;
    - **completeness (non-tautology)**: every both-sides-divergent canonical
      ``kitty-specs/**`` artifact enumerated from the INDEPENDENT
      mission-artifact-kind registry (``mission_runtime.artifacts`` —
      ``MissionArtifactKind`` + ``_MISSION_FILE_KIND_BY_BASENAME`` /
      ``_COORD_RESIDUE_DIRS`` / ``kind_for_mission_file``), NOT enumerated from
      ``.gitattributes`` itself, carries a registered merge driver. Fail-closed: a
      *future* net-new canonical artifact re-inherits #2709 via ``-X theirs``
      unless it is a driver or is explicitly classified as non-divergent below.

# RULING: option (a) -- a reconcile driver -- not option (b). Option (b)
# requires "a passing test that demonstrates the clobber scenario cannot
# occur"; no such test can be honest today. Per the ADR's own measurement, a
# coord mission's first review cycle for a WP lands PRIMARY (create-window
# split, T018) and every later cycle lands COORD -- BOTH are live for the SAME
# wp_id simultaneously during the migration window, before WP05a's atomicity
# and WP06b's consumer unification land, so nothing in the tree today
# structurally prevents the #2804 clobber shape for `tasks/<wp>/review-cycle-
# <N>.md`. Per the WP's own instruction ("if you cannot produce such a test,
# option (a) is required, not preferred"), (a) is the ruling.
#
# NOT landed as a driver diff in this WP: implementing (a) requires (1) a NEW
# merge-driver command (union-merging two independently-numbered review-cycle
# documents is not a safe line-union like `merge_driver_traces` -- two
# DIFFERENT verdicts under the SAME filename must not be interleaved into one
# nonsensical document; the correct reconciliation needs to coordinate with
# WP09's numbering rework, not just union bytes) PLUS (2) registration across
# FOUR surfaces (`.gitattributes`, `specify_cli.lanes.consolidation._MERGE_DRIVERS`,
# the `init` command seed, an upgrade migration) that are ALL outside this
# WP's `owned_files`. Recorded as an explicit, cited, time-critical cross-WP
# dependency in WP04's review findings instead of
# silently expanding this WP's file ownership (mirrors T015's caller-side
# finding).
#
# This test PINS the current, honest state (no driver yet) as a fail-closed
# tripwire: it goes RED the instant the review-cycle pattern coincides with an
# already-registered driver (drift-catcher) and is the single place a future
# WP flips the assertion to a positive "driver IS registered" check once the
# cross-WP dependency above is closed.
#
# verdict-seam-write-unification-01KZ9Q35 WP09 (FR-014/D-PLAN-6): the driver

# squash). WP05 of this later mission demoted the ``.md`` render to
# non-authoritative, unread best-effort prose (``status.events.jsonl``'s
# ``review_result`` slot is the sole verdict authority now), so the
# fabrication risk that justified refusing no longer applies -- WP09
# DOWNGRADED the driver to non-aborting: it still embeds both divergent
# renders verbatim behind conflict markers (never blending/fabricating a
# merged verdict), but no longer raises, so the squash proceeds. This test's
# own assertions below are unaffected (they only check the driver stays
# REGISTERED in .gitattributes, not its exit-code class) --
