"""Reference-kind enum ratchet — pins ADR FR-006 / NFR-001 / SC-005.

WP06 of mission ``doctrine-silence-guards-01KYFV7Q``.

Why this exists
----------------
Four doctrine schemas each declare a ``<kind>_reference`` definition whose
``properties.type.enum`` names every doctrine artefact kind that definition's
artefact may reference: :data:`_REFERENCE_TARGETS` below. The enum is meant to be
frozen — widening it re-opens exactly the kind-vocabulary drift the doctrine layer
exists to close (DIRECTIVE_043) — but before this module the freeze was **only a
comment**. Nothing re-read the schemas and compared them against anything, so a
member added to any of the four enums shipped green. That is the silence this
mission closes; a comment did not stop the enum-widening attempt that started this
programme, which is the direct motivation for FR-006.

The four targets, derived once from the shipped schemas (WP05, ``remediation/
doctrine-silence-guards`` @ the commit this baseline was pinned from) and never
re-derived at test time:

* ``directive.schema.yaml`` :: ``directive_reference`` — 12 members
* ``tactic.schema.yaml``    :: ``tactic_reference``     — 7 members
* ``procedure.schema.yaml`` :: ``procedure_reference``  — 12 members
* ``paradigm.schema.yaml``  :: ``paradigm_reference``   — 7 members (WP05 renamed
  this definition from the bare ``reference`` and, in the same change, dropped
  ``agent_profile``/``mission_step_contract`` from its enum — a paradigm cannot
  legally reference either kind, so the narrower set is intentional, not drift).

A frozen baseline, not a live re-derivation
--------------------------------------------
:data:`_BASELINE` is a **literal, committed** dict of the member sets above. A
ratchet that re-reads the same schemas at test time and compares them to
themselves cannot fail — the charter's ``frozen-baseline-shrink-only-ratchet``
tactic is explicit that the baseline must be a committed value, not derived from
the thing being checked. Growth (a member present in the schema but absent from
the committed baseline) fails the gate outright, mirroring the tactic's
"growth fails" rule applied at the granularity of set membership rather than a
bare count — a swap-one-member-for-another edit keeps the count constant while
still being exactly the drift this gate exists to catch. Shrinkage (a baseline
member no longer present in the schema) only warns, exactly as the tactic
specifies, so legitimate narrowing (like WP05's paradigm-enum trim above) is not
blocked.

Non-vacuity (NFR-001)
----------------------
:class:`TestRatchetNonVacuity` plants a real violation — the frozen baseline plus
one smuggled member, written to a ``tmp_path`` schema fixture — and asserts the
gate rejects it. It calls **the same** :func:`_enum_members` /
:func:`_grown_members` pair the shipped-tree assertion below uses, differing only
in which schema path it is pointed at. A self-mutation test that reimplements the
walk inline would stay green forever while this walk rotted; this is the WP01
rejection finding this mission carries forward.

Concrete floor
--------------
An absence assertion (``not grown``) passes vacuously on a parse that silently
found nothing, so :func:`_enum_members` returning an empty set must itself be
loud. ``test_enum_resolves_to_a_non_empty_set`` asserts each of the four targets
resolves to a non-empty member set *before* any growth comparison runs, and
``test_ratchet_covers_exactly_four_distinct_targets`` asserts the target list
itself has not silently collapsed to fewer than four distinct schema/definition
pairs.
