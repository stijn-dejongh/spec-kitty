"""Literal-ban ratchet: worktree/branch name-guessing forbidden outside the seam.

This is the **filesystem twin** of the branch-identity seam — the 4th ratchet
assertion guarding the recurring wrong-compose regression class
(#1860 / #1949 / #1978 / #1899). The single canonical naming seam,
``src/specify_cli/lanes/branch_naming.py``, composes AND parses every mission /
lane / worktree / coordination directory name keyed on the declared
``(slug, mission_id)`` (FR-001 / FR-005). Any other module that hand-rolls a
worktree-dir, mission-branch, or mid8-dedup name reintroduces the defect: a
mid8-era mission whose on-disk worktree is ``<slug>-<mid8>-lane-x`` is mis-named
``<slug>-lane-x`` by a bare ``f"{slug}-{lane}"`` guess, so the path never
resolves (the #1899 class).

The ratchet scans every ``*.py`` under ``src/specify_cli/`` and ``src/runtime/``
for THREE forbidden idioms (the squad showed the first two alone miss the actual
recurrence shape):

1. **worktree-dir name-guess** — a ``.worktrees/`` path composed via an
   interpolated f-string, INCLUDING the assign-then-join indirection
   (``name = f"{slug}-{lane}"`` then ``... / ".worktrees" / name``). Caught by
   walking ``/``-division chains where one operand is a ``.worktrees`` literal /
   ``WORKTREES_DIR*`` name and another is an interpolated f-string (directly, or
   via a local name bound earlier in the function to such an f-string).
2. **branch name-guess** — a literal ``f"kitty/mission-{…}"`` (interpolated)
   not produced by the seam.
3. **inline mid8 re-dedup / bare mission-dir compose** — the
   ``…endswith(f"-{mid8}")…`` / ``endswith(suffix)`` compose idiom and the bare
   ``f"{slug}-{mid8}"`` mission-dir composition — the #1860/#1949 recurrence
   shape that carries NO ``.worktrees/`` literal (this is what would catch the
   historical ``tasks.py:844`` / ``_create.py:157`` sites).

Allow-list: exactly the seam module ``lanes/branch_naming.py`` (the sole legal
home of these idioms) plus a SMALL number of narrowly-justified, individually
commented carve-outs for genuinely-benign uses that are NOT a name compose
(e.g. a ``git branch --list`` glob, or a string fed straight back into the seam
PARSER). Each carve-out is a drift-proof ``(enclosing_qualname, token_line)``
composite key — inserting a blank or comment line above a pinned site does NOT
flip the ratchet RED (FR-008 / WP06 re-key).

Design-P REFERENCE implementation (do NOT convert)
--------------------------------------------------
This module is the canonical **reference implementation** of the *Design-P
content-pinned gate-key* pattern, named as such by the refactor-stable doctrine
(the ``testing-principles`` styleguide) and mission
``refactor-stable-gate-substrate-01KWK3FY``. Design-P freezes a tool-derived
``(enclosing_qualname, token)`` comparand (see ``_ALLOWED_SITES_FILES`` above)
and scans live source for set membership, so a gate key is pinned to CONTENT,
never to a raw line number. The pattern's two proof legs live here as the
template every other converted gate mirrors:

* ``test_name_compose_offenders_match_pinned_baseline`` — the staleness guard: a
  frozen allow-list entry with no live offender (or an extra unjustified entry)
  drifts the pinned baseline count and trips RED.
* ``test_composite_key_survives_line_drift`` — the drift theater: shifting a
  pinned site down by blank/comment lines leaves its composite key unchanged, so
  the ratchet stays GREEN on pure line drift.

**These key semantics MUST NOT be converted to seed-derivation** (the
``_RAW_JOIN_SITES`` load-time-seed style). Seed-derivation is content-FOLLOWING:
a fixed line seed still breaks on drift and a content edit is invisible — it
fails both halves of NFR-001 and would REGRESS this file's content-detection.
The mission's research D1 proves this empirically; FR-005's earlier
"convert Family E" plan was CANCELLED for exactly this reason. This file is the
destination pattern, not a conversion target.

# ===========================================================================
# WP02 (this mission) — AST short-id slice detector + failover-bypass rule.
#
# A SECOND ratchet, distinct from the name-COMPOSE idioms above: it forbids
# hand-derived mission ``mid8`` SHORT-IDs (``mission_id[:8]`` and friends)
# outside the single sanctioned derivation home. The recurring defect this
# guards (FR-004 / FR-010) is a consumer that re-slices the mission_id to a
# mid8 instead of routing through ``resolve_mid8`` — the failover-aware
# entrypoint that reconciles a stale slug tail against the declared identity.
# A bare ``mission_id[:8]`` skips that reconciliation and silently mis-routes
# a colliding-tail mission (the #1899 / #1978 class).
#
# ⚠️ HONESTY NOTE — scope and known limits (binding; do NOT overclaim):
#   * This is a **syntax-level tripwire**, not a completeness oracle. It is
#     defeated by helper indirection: ``def _short(x): return x[:8]`` then
#     ``_short(mission_id)`` carries no ``[:8]`` at the call site and escapes.
#     The real correctness guarantee for this mission is
#     verification-by-deletion: WP03/WP04/WP05 deleted every consumer slice and
#     the suite stayed green. This ratchet only stops a *future* regrowth of
#     the exact syntactic shape.
#   * AST cannot structurally distinguish ``mission_id`` from ``invocation_id``
#     or a content hash — detection rests on a NAME predicate (substring
#     ``mission_id`` / ``mid``). The predicate is deliberately a SUBSTRING/glob,
#     never exact-match, so ``str(raw_mission_id)[:8]`` and ``mission_id_meta``
#     (the original blind spots Paula found) cannot escape via a wrapper or a
#     suffix.
#   * It explicitly does **NOT** cover the deferred ``feature_dir.parent.parent``
#     repo-root-derivation class (~9 sites), which is owned by the read-path /
#     error-fidelity follow-on focus (#2007), not this mission.
# ===========================================================================

# (``mission_runtime/context.py``) and potential consumers (``mission_runtime``,
# ``charter``, ``glossary``, ...) live outside that subset. Benign content-hash
# / state slices in those packages carry neither ``mission_id`` nor ``mid`` in
