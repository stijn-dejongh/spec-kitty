"""Zero-producer lint — a declared slot that nothing populates must fail a test.

WP01 of mission ``doctrine-silence-guards-01KYFV7Q`` (FR-001, NFR-001, SC-001).

Why this exists
---------------
The precedent this guards against is measured, not theoretical: **three schema slots
have shipped inert in this repository, one of them green for 162 days behind passing
tests.** A field is added, a schema property is added to match, nothing ever writes
it, and every test stays green because nothing asserts that a declared thing is a
used thing. This module makes that a red test.

It is the first work package of its mission for a reason — it is what proves the
gates the later packages add are not themselves inert. Missions B1 and B2 add
``impacts``, ``is_symmetric`` and ``aliases``; C-009 requires each to arrive with a
producer *and* a coverage gate in the same commit, and this lint is the mechanism
that makes that requirement checkable rather than aspirational.

The definition (T001)
---------------------
An earlier definition was **self-annihilating** and is recorded here so it is not
reinvented. It read: *"a slot is both a model field and a JSON-Schema property; a
producer is any writer under src/ or the generated schemas."* Slots were a subset of
schema properties and producers included the generated schemas, so **every slot had a
producer by construction** — the lint would return the empty set on any tree and pass
its own zero-entry allowlist vacuously. The gate meant to prevent a fourth inert
register would have been the fourth inert register.

The adopted definition:

**Slot** — a declared, populatable field:

* a Pydantic model field declared under ``src/doctrine/**/models.py``, or
* a JSON-Schema *property* under ``src/doctrine/schemas/*.schema.yaml``.

  A schema ``definitions/`` entry is **not** a slot. It is a ``$ref`` target — a type,
  not a place data goes. The slot is the property that *uses* it. Getting this wrong
  is what would flag ``point_in_time_marker`` (see the anchors below).

**Producer** — anything that actually puts a value in the slot:

* a shipped doctrine artefact under ``src/doctrine/**`` carrying the key, **or**
* code **under ``src/doctrine/``** that assigns it.

  Scoped to the doctrine tree, not all of ``src/``, and the scope is load-bearing.
  Matching is by bare name (see the under-count section), so a wider producer scan
  means any unrelated local variable anywhere in the CLI masks a doctrine slot.
  Harvesting all of ``src/`` produced 12,742 names against 807 here — and among the
  11,935 it added were ``aliases`` and ``overrides``. That is not a rounding error:
  ``aliases`` is one of the three fields SC-001 names, so the whole-``src`` version
  of this gate **did not guard the thing it was written to guard**.

**The generated schemas are explicitly NOT producers.** They are the thing being
checked. Admitting them is precisely what made the earlier definition vacuous.

Note the asymmetry, because it is the whole point: a *reader* is not a producer. Code
that consumes a slot proves the slot is wired at the consumption end and says nothing
about whether anything fills it. But an **authored artefact** carrying the key *is* a
producer — in a doctrine layer most slots are filled by YAML authors, not by
assignment statements.

Calibration anchors
-------------------
Both were expected to be inert specimens and **both turn out not to be**, which makes
them the two most useful cases in the tree: they are the nearest-miss false positives,
and each defeats a different naive rule.

``structural_lint_config``
    Declared at ``styleguides/models.py:92``; its only code contact is a *reader*
    (``assets/built-in/docs_structural_lint.py``). A naive "producer = code that
    writes it" rule flags it. It is **not** inert: ``common-docs.styleguide.yaml``
    populates it. Mission A's WP05 is simultaneously defending this field as valid, so
    a lint that flags it would put two work packages in direct contradiction.

``point_in_time_marker``
    Declared in **no** model, present at ``schemas/styleguide.schema.yaml:14``. A naive
    "slot = model field ∩ schema property" rule cannot see it; a naive "slot = any
    schema key" rule flags it. Neither is right: it is a ``definitions/`` entry, i.e. a
    ``$ref`` target rather than a slot, and the *property* that uses it
    (``point_in_time_markers``) is both populated by ``common-docs.styleguide.yaml``
    and read by the asset.

The historical inert set is **derived, not cited**. An earlier draft referred to
"three known-inert cases" that no artefact names — a calibration set that does not
exist cannot falsify anything, and invites picking three cases that flatter the
definition. Whatever this lint reports on the shipped tree *is* the finding.

Known under-counts — and what they cost
---------------------------------------
Two of them. Both make the lint **under**-report, never over-report, so the true
debt is ``>= 59``. State the forward consequence, not just the arithmetic: an
under-count does not merely hide debt, it can silently retire one of this gate's
named duties.

**1. Bare-name matching.** Slots are matched to producers by name with no
namespacing, so a slot is masked whenever an unrelated same-named producer exists
anywhere in the scanned tree. This one already cost a guard duty once: while
producers were harvested from all of ``src/``, ``aliases`` was masked by unrelated
CLI code, so **mission B2 could have shipped ``aliases`` inert with this gate
green** — SC-001's central promise, quietly void. ``overrides`` was masked the same
way, hiding half the FR-028 pair. Scoping producers to ``src/doctrine/`` recovered
both. The residual risk is a collision *inside* the doctrine tree; per-kind
namespacing would close it and is a change to the definition, not this work
package's to make.

**2. ``_model_slots`` globs only ``models.py``.** Roughly 99 Pydantic fields are
invisible to the slot side: ``agent_profiles/profile.py`` (68),
``missions/step_contracts.py`` (23), ``drg/org_pack_config.py`` (8), plus
``base.py``, ``drg/merge.py`` and ``drg/org_pack_loader.py``. Concretely, the
agent-profile findings below are schema-side only — their Python twins
(``avatar_image``, ``toolguide_references``, …) are simply not seen. Widening the
glob is deferred, not solved.

The baseline is not an allowlist (operator ruling)
--------------------------------------------------
SC-001 asked for a zero-entry allowlist. The lint's first run on the shipped tree
returned 41 findings whose owners run **after** this work package (WP05) or in a
later mission (Mission D / I9): the dependency is inverted, and the criterion was
written against a tree that turned out not to be clean. The operator's ruling is a
frozen shrink-only baseline at ``_inert_slots_baseline.yaml``.

The distinction the next reader will otherwise collapse:

``ALLOWLIST``
    permanently excused. Stays ``frozenset()``, and ``test_allowlist_is_empty``
    keeps it there.
the baseline
    **debt**, not an excuse. Every entry carries a named ``owner``, one of exactly
    three structural ``disposition`` values (none of which is "accept"), and
    ``test_a_baseline_entry_does_not_survive_its_owner`` fails the moment that owner
    completes with the entry still present. Clearing the entry is a precondition of
    the owner being done — which is the whole reason this is a baseline and not an
    ``xfail``.

Growth above the baseline FAILS; shrinkage WARNS (charter Burn-down Policy §a), and
the file's size is registered with the charter-named ratchet in ``_baselines.yaml``
so nothing about it is pinned only by this module.

``unassigned`` is the hole in that claim, and it is capped
------------------------------------------------------------
``owner_is_complete`` returns ``False`` unconditionally for ``unassigned``, so the
anti-weasel test is *structurally incapable* of firing for those entries — the
"fails the moment that owner completes" promise is simply false for them. Combined
with the growth rule (a new finding must enter the baseline to pass), an
``unassigned`` row is a legal way to satisfy the gate without doing any work: it
never fires, never expires, never requires adjudication. Two things hold the line:

* ``MAX_UNASSIGNED_ENTRIES`` — a shrink-only cap, so the hatch cannot widen while
  the current set is adjudicated.
* ``test_every_named_owner_resolves`` — every non-``unassigned`` owner must name a
  real WP or mission in the event log, so ``WP42``, ``wp05`` and ``mission:typo``
  cannot masquerade as owned work. (They would read as "never complete", which is
  indistinguishable from live debt.)

Concrete floor (charter §5)
---------------------------
Every shipped-tree assertion here is an **absence** assertion — ``new == []``,
``offenders == {}``, ``name not in flagged`` — and all of them pass on a scan that
found nothing at all. The ``tmp_path`` self-mutation tests cannot cover this: they
build their own tree, so the shipped-tree path stays unpinned. Relocate
``src/doctrine``, rename the ``models.py`` convention, or land any refactor that
empties either walk, and this whole module goes inert behind green tests.
``test_the_scan_actually_sees_the_shipped_tree`` is the floor that pins it.

**Floored per walk, and that revision was earned.** The first floor pinned the
*union* of the two walks, which caught total collapse and missed partial collapse:
renaming the ``models.py`` convention kills the model walk — 145 distinct names, 23
baseline entries — while the surviving schema side (186 / 36) cleared a union floor
of 180/35, the entry half by exactly one. Review demonstrated it with a four-line
mutation: **25 passed** with half the gate dead. This docstring asserted the
opposite at the time, which is the part that mattered — a false coverage claim in
the gate whose whole job is to stop mechanisms going quietly inert. Both walks are
now floored independently, and both mutations go red.

**Entries-still-found floors are proportional, not absolute (WP05, FR-005).** The
name floors (``MINIMUM_SCHEMA_SLOT_NAMES`` / ``MINIMUM_MODEL_SLOT_NAMES``) stay
hardcoded — they pin the walk against wholesale collapse and have no relationship
to the baseline file's size. The *entries-still-found* floors were hardcoded too
(30 / 18) until WP05's FR-028 excision legitimately shrank the schema baseline
36 -> 28 (the ``enhances``/``overrides`` pair, four schemas each), which would have
tripped an absolute 30-floor on a change that did nothing wrong — and "lower the
floor" is indistinguishable at review time from quietly hiding a regression, which
is the same failure class this section already tells that story about once. WP05
converted both to ``len(BASELINE_SLOTS filtered by walk)`` — see
``_inert_slots.py`` — so they move automatically when a baseline entry is deleted
(the correct response to cleared debt) and still catch the 0-producer collapse
this floor exists for: ``0 >= 28`` fails exactly as hard as ``0 >= 30`` did.

Non-vacuity (NFR-001)
---------------------
``test_planted_producerless_slot_is_flagged`` plants a real violation and asserts RED.
Critically it calls **the same** :func:`find_inert_slots` as the shipped-tree
assertion, differing only in the tree it is pointed at. A self-mutation test that
reimplements the check inline is green forever while the production checker rots.

The anti-weasel check needs the same treatment, and for a sharper reason: today no
owner has completed, so it passes **vacuously**.
``test_the_anti_weasel_check_fires_when_an_owner_completes`` plants a synthetic
mission whose owner is ``done`` and asserts the check reports it — otherwise this
mission would have shipped a guard against inert mechanisms that was itself inert.
