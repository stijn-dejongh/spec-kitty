"""Static model of the CI test-selection matrix (Issue #2034 / #1933).

CI selects tests **by marker** (``fast`` / ``integration`` / ``git_repo`` /
``slow`` / ``architectural`` / ``windows_ci`` / ``quarantine`` / ``timing`` /
``distribution``) combined with **path** arguments, sharded across many jobs.
The authoring taxonomy (``pytest.ini`` documents ``unit`` as "the category
default for module-scoped tests"; ``contract`` for contract tests) diverges
from that *selection* taxonomy: **no gate selects ``-m unit`` or
``-m contract``**, and several test directories are touched by no gate at all.
Historically, that mismatch left tests selected by **zero** gates —
"untested-but-green". This model now keeps that orphan surface at zero.

This module is the *enforcement substrate* for that gap. It does not re-tier or
re-shard CI (that is the maintainer's migration, against this guardrail). It
statically:

1. Parses every ``pytest`` invocation across the six workflow files that run
   the suite (``ci-quality`` / ``ci-windows`` / ``doctrine-charter-tests`` /
   ``drift-detector`` / ``release`` / ``ui-e2e``), expanding the
   ``integration-tests-core-misc`` shard matrix.
2. Models each invocation as a :class:`Gate` = ``(paths, ignores, marker_expr)``.
3. Evaluates every collected test against every gate, using pytest's own
   marker-expression evaluator, to count how many gates select it.

A test selected by **0** gates is an *orphan* (coverage hole); a test selected
by **>=2** gates is a *duplicate* (intentional overlap is allowed — reported,
not enforced).

The companion end-to-end oracle
(``test_ci_collection_completeness.py``) requires zero primary-push orphans.
It runs in the PR operator path through ``arch-adversarial`` → ``quality-gate``
and has an independent ``fast-tests-core-misc`` owner for route-affecting
changes. GitHub branch protection currently requires only ``drift-detector``;
this module does not misrepresent the operator gate as a required context.

Run directly to refresh/verify the topology census or the separate retained E3
job-selection baselines::

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Trigger-state job activation (mission doctrine-silence-guards WP10, FR-013 /
# SC-013 / issue #2957).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. :func:`analyze` counts a test as covered when ANY parsed gate
# selects it — a model in which every job always runs. Real CI does not work
# that way: 40 of the 50 suite-running jobs are gated on a ``dorny/paths-filter``
# output, so on a push whose diff misses those globs the job never starts and
# every test it uniquely owns runs nowhere. That is the same defect as WP01's
# inert schema slot, one layer up: a frozen-contract test no job collects is
# exactly as inert as a schema slot nothing produces.
#
# WHAT IS MODELED. The two path-topology authorities the module already parses
# (Adjudicated Decision 8: the dorny filter block and the job ``if:`` gates),
# plus the ``on:`` trigger block. Nothing new is parsed from the workflow — the
# only new capability is DECIDING a parsed ``if:`` against a named trigger
# state, which no existing surface does.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED BY CONSTRUCTION. :func:`job_runs_under` returns ``True`` only for
# conditions it positively recognizes as satisfied; anything it does not model
# is treated as "does not run". The consequence of a mis-read is therefore an
# over-report of uncollected tests (a loud red someone must look at), never a
# silent claim of coverage that does not exist.
#
# ONE DELIBERATE EXCEPTION, AND WHAT IT COSTS THE CLAIM. Exactly one conjunct
# fails OPEN: ``needs.<job>.result == 'success'`` decides ``True``
# (:data:`_NEEDS_RESULT_RE_CONJUNCT`). It has to — reading it as unsatisfiable
# would declare every downstream job dead and leave nothing to reason about. The
# property this module can therefore state is "collected on a push to ``main``
# ON THE GREEN PATH": when an upstream job fails, GitHub skips its dependents and
# a real run collects less than modelled. So an uncollected count from here is
# exact on a green run and a LOWER BOUND on a red one — the error direction is
# "the hole is at least this big", never "there is no hole".

# E3 baseline node-id manifests + GC-2b diff guard (mission
# ci-test-topology-performance-01KXBJRT WP02, FR-007/NFR-005 — this mission's
# load-bearing invariant).
#
# SCOPE (corrected after a first cut baselined all 22 suite-running jobs and
# compared a MODELED-current selection against a REAL baseline): WP06 only
# CHANGES the SELECTED test set for three jobs —
#   - integration-tests-next: sharded into a next_shard_1/2/3 matrix (E1).
#   - slow-tests: path-narrowed (risk of a dropped directory).
#   - fast-tests-core-misc: shard-rebalanced (already 2 legs today).
# Everything else WP06 touches (WP-G's ``-n auto``, the fast-tests-charter
# job split, ...) is parallelization-only — the selected test set is
# unchanged — so baselining it adds cost with no coverage-preservation
# signal. GC-2b therefore guards exactly these three jobs.
#
# COMPARISON SHAPE (modeled-current vs real-baseline): the committed
# ``baseline`` side is REAL — a scoped ``pytest --collect-only -q`` per job leg
# (:func:`collect_real_union_for_target` / :func:`collect_job_nodeids`), frozen
# once by ``--freeze-baselines``. The day-to-day ``current`` side is the MODEL
# (:class:`CompiledGate` via :func:`_selected_nodeids`) evaluated over ONE shared
# :func:`collect_universe`, so the parametrized cases reuse a single collection
# instead of spawning a real ``--collect-only`` per case (a CI-speed mission must
# not add ~10min to its own arch shard). Because the baseline is real and
# model-independent, a ``selects()`` that mis-parsed a job's ``-m`` expression or
# positional path DIVERGES from the real baseline and GC-2b reds — the real
# baseline IS the fidelity check for these three jobs. A separate scoped
# model-fidelity anchor (modeled == a FRESH real collect) is kept for the
# sharded ``next`` tier in ``test_ci_collection_completeness.py`` to catch a
# mis-model on the job most at risk of one.
