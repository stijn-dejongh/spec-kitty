"""Parity oracle primitives for the ``runtime_bridge`` characterization suite.

Mission ``runtime-bridge-degod-01KX8M1C`` (#2531), WP01 — the BLOCKING safety
net that every extraction WP (WP03-WP10) re-runs as its acceptance gate. See
``kitty-specs/runtime-bridge-degod-01KX8M1C/contracts/parity-oracle.md`` for
the authoritative contract; this module implements it verbatim.

This module owns three concerns, corresponding to contract sections:

* **Equality contract** (``canonical`` / ``assert_parity``) — the
  MASK / PATH-NORMALIZE / STABLE partition over ``Decision.to_dict()``.
* **Capture-and-assert side-effect isolation** (``capture_side_effects``,
  ``SideEffectCapture``) — binding equality on recorded payloads, not mere
  stubbing.
* **Coverage-floor bookkeeping** (``capture_decision_sites``,
  ``capture_guard_calls``, ``CoverageLedger``, ``assert_coverage_floor_met``)
  — a *checkable count* of the 29 ``Decision(...)`` sites and the guard
  branches, each tallied from its owning public entry, so a hollow oracle
  (one that drives zero/few sites) cannot pass silently.

Nothing here stubs ``next_step`` / ``get_or_start_run`` — the runtime planner
is the logic under test (WP01 safeguard). All capture wrappers call through
to the real implementation and only *observe* the call.

**Scope of the guarantee (read before over-trusting a green oracle).** Every
assertion compares two independent runs of the *current* code; there are no
stored golden baselines. This oracle therefore catches: non-determinism,
coverage-floor regressions, and binding-equality breaks in the captured side
effects. It does NOT, on its own, catch a *consistent* behavior change across
an extraction (both runs shift identically). The compensating control is that
every extraction WP (WP03–WP10) ALSO re-runs the full existing runtime test
suite (``tests/next/*``, ``tests/integration/test_*_runtime_walk.py``, …),
which pins specific decide_next / query / answer outputs. Treat this oracle as
the coverage-floor + determinism + side-effect-payload guarantee layered ON TOP
of that suite, not as a standalone golden characterization.
