"""WP06 / T013 — completeness gate for the Bucket-2 workflow migration manifest.

Mission `workflow-mechanics-self-doc-01M02SF1` ("Bucket 2") audited the
~49 workflow/CI/git/status-and-sync **mechanics** entries in the operator's
local, gitignored agent-memory file and produced a resolution for each,
grouped into three clusters (A &#8212; landing/git, B &#8212; CI, C &#8212;
status/mission/sync). The working audit that classified each entry
(``work/bucket2-workflow-memory-audit.md``) is gitignored and does not exist
in this worktree or in CI &#8212; so the manifest at
:mod:`docs/development/agent-memory-workflow-migration-manifest.md` **is**
the committed authority, not a summary of one.

This module does **not** hardcode the 49-entry list as an inline literal
(that would be the exact tautology this gate exists to prevent &#8212; a test
that can only ever agree with itself). Instead it parses the manifest's own
Cluster A/B/C markdown tables at collection/run time and asserts three
structural properties against whatever rows are actually there:

1. all three clusters (A, B, C) are present;
2. every parsed row carries exactly one recognised resolution token
   (``home:`` / ``already-home:`` / ``learned-fact:`` / ``keep-private`` /
   ``charter-candidate``);
3. every path-bearing token (``home:``, ``already-home:``,
   ``learned-fact:``) resolves to a real file on disk; the two pathless
   tokens (``keep-private``, ``charter-candidate``) are recognised without a
   path.

A manifest edited to drop a cluster, leave a row unresolved, or point a
path-bearing token at a file that doesn't exist goes red here &#8212; the
whole point being that the manifest's claims are checked, not merely
displayed.
