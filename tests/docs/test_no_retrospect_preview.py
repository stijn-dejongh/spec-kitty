"""Guard test: ``retrospect synthesize`` must never be paired with ``--preview``.

The ``spec-kitty agent retrospect synthesize`` command is dry-run by default and
takes ``--apply`` to mutate; it does NOT accept a ``--preview`` flag (see
``src/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent_retrospect.py::synthesize_cmd``).

Stale guidance that tells operators to run ``... synthesize ... --preview`` is a
documentation bug because the flag does not exist. This test scans the owned
source tree (``src/`` and ``docs/``) plus the repo-root mission-workflow file and
fails if any ``retrospect synthesize`` reference still pairs with ``--preview``.

Excluded from the scan:
- ``kitty-specs/`` (historical mission artifacts, intentionally frozen)
- generated agent copies under dot-directories (``.claude/``, ``.agents/``,
  ``.amazonq/``, etc.) which are produced from the source templates
