"""Single-source arch-adversarial pole shard-assignment table (FR-004, FR-005).

Mission ``ci-health-charter-path-and-arch-shard-01KWRTB2`` WP02 (#2397). The
``arch-adversarial`` CI job today runs the 4 pole roots — ``tests/adversarial``,
``tests/architectural``, ``tests/architecture``, ``tests/lint`` — as a single
14.4-minute matrix leg. This module is the **single committed source of truth**
for splitting that pole into 3 balanced, disjoint shards, keyed by whole
test-file (for ``tests/architectural/*.py``) or whole directory (for the other
three pole roots, folded in as functional units per the operator's
"whole test files kept intact, not split" steer, Decision Moment
``DM-01KWRWB0PPF5TQPNYF5D07XY3W``).

The concrete assignment below is copied **verbatim** from
``kitty-specs/ci-health-charter-path-and-arch-shard-01KWRTB2/data-model.md``
(a 216 / 215 / 215 greedy bin-packing result balanced by a ``def test_`` count
proxy — see ``research.md`` R2 for the honesty caveat that this is a structural
projection, not a live-duration measurement). Do not re-derive a different
split here; rebalance by editing this table directly if a future CI run shows
material drift.

``tests/conftest.py``'s ``pytest_collection_modifyitems`` hook applies the
matching ``arch_shard_<N>`` marker to every collected test whose file falls
under one of the 4 pole roots, looked up via :func:`shard_for`. Nothing outside
those roots is touched: :func:`shard_for` returns ``None`` for any other path,
which is what keeps the hook scoped (enforced by
``tests/architectural/test_arch_shard_marker_completeness.py``, IC-03).

This module is pure data + one lookup function — no pytest import, no side
effects — so it stays trivially unit-testable and reviewable as "just a table."
