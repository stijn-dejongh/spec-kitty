"""WP04 / FR-001: recovery COMPOSES — ``doctor --fix`` -> re-run upgrade (SC-001).

This is a **verification** WP: it owns no product module. It proves that three
already-shipped behaviours compose into self-recovery for a wedged project, with
**zero manual git steps** (SC-001) and without requiring version control at all:

* **FR-002 / WP01** (``runner.py`` + ``metadata.py``): a failed migration
  PRESERVES ``schema_version`` instead of erasing it. Before WP01 a mid-migration
  abort dropped ``schema_version``, so a re-run re-detected the project as legacy
  and re-hit the same failing migration on the still-invalid corpus — permanently
  wedged (#3334, P0).
* **FR-008 / WP03** (``status/dup_key_repair.py`` + ``doctor mission-state
  --fix``): heals a legacy dual-key ``review_feedback`` artifact (invalid YAML the
  frontmatter boundary fails CLOSED on, #3372) — the thing an upgrade migration
  trips over.
* **FR-012 / WP01**: a re-run after the corpus is healed applies the migration
  cleanly and stamps the target schema (resumable, no-op on already-done work).

The composition is a **SEQUENCE**, not a new orchestrator (paula-patterns
post-tasks finding: no recovery surface exists and none is needed). The honest
hinge proven here is that the SAME upgrade migration FAILS while the artifact
carries the duplicate key and SUCCEEDS once ``--fix`` has healed it — so the heal
is genuinely what unblocks the upgrade, not incidental.

Scope discipline: ``doctor --fix`` also runs an unrelated mission-state
canonicalization pass (``repair_repo``) that is a *separate* FR path needing full
mission scaffolding (``meta.json`` / status logs). It is isolated here (WP03
CLI-test precedent) so this proof stays pinned to the FR-002 + FR-008 + FR-012
composition and cannot flake on mission-state-repair concerns it does not own.
