    The machine layout-generation record this test drives directly
    (``begin_cutover`` / ``publish_project_only``) is scoped to
    ``SPEC_KITTY_HOME`` as a WHOLE, not to this test's project UUID (see
    ``layout_generation.LayoutGenerationAuthority`` — the record lives at
    ``<runtime_root>/projects/.layout-generation.json``). Without pinning
    ``SPEC_KITTY_HOME`` to this test's own ``tmp_path``, it shares the
    per-worker home other ``tests/cli`` and ``tests/sync`` cases reuse across
    the whole pytest session; an earlier test that auto-resolves the machine
    layout to ``PROJECT_ONLY`` would make this test's own ``begin_cutover``
    call fail with "layout is already project-only". Pin the home explicitly
    (matching ``tests/sync/test_layout_cutover.py``'s ``_isolate`` pattern) so
    this test always starts from a fresh LEGACY record.
