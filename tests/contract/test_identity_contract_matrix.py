"""Identity contract matrix — the catch-all backstop for FR-062 / FR-063.

This test file enumerates every machine-facing payload surface that mission 083
migrated to the canonical ``mission_id`` identity and asserts that ``mission_id``
is present (or that ``aggregate_id`` is the ULID) in each one.

Surfaces covered
----------------
1. **Status snapshot** — ``StatusSnapshot.to_dict()``:
   the materialised per-mission view written to ``status.json``.
   It must carry the canonical identity fields via
   ``mission_identity_fields(...)``.

2. **Status event envelope (WP-level)** — ``StatusEvent.to_dict()``:
   WP-level events use ``aggregate_id = wp_id`` but the envelope must still
   include ``mission_id`` when the event was written post-WP05.
   (Legacy events without ``mission_id`` survive as compatibility; the field
   is simply omitted.  That case is covered by a separate negative assertion.)

3. **Merge state** — ``MergeState.to_dict()``:
   the persisted merge state at
   ``.kittify/runtime/merge/<mission_id>/state.json`` is keyed by
   ``mission_id`` (WP02 + WP10).

4. **Lane manifest** — ``LanesManifest.to_dict()``:
   the per-feature ``lanes.json`` file carries ``mission_id`` alongside
   ``mission_slug``.

5. **SaaS mission-lifecycle events** — ``EventEmitter.emit_mission_created``
   (and siblings ``emit_mission_closed`` / ``emit_mission_origin_bound``):
   when called with ``mission_id``, the emitted event's ``aggregate_id``
   switches from slug to ULID and ``payload.mission_id`` is populated.
   This is the single biggest contract surface for the SaaS-side migration
   (tracked in spec-kitty-saas#47).

6. **Dossier snapshot** — ``.kittify/dossiers/<slug>/snapshot-latest.json``:
   the current dossier snapshot schema does NOT yet carry a top-level
   ``mission_id`` field. Mission 083 deliberately left dossier snapshots
   keyed by slug to avoid expanding scope beyond the immediate collision
   problem. This surface is enumerated here with an explicit ``skip`` so a
   future follow-up can re-enable it without re-discovering the contract.

Design notes
------------
- Each surface is exercised against **real production code**, not mocks,
  whenever possible.  The tests emit synthetic payloads through the real
  ``to_dict()`` paths.
- The ``EventEmitter`` surface uses the shared ``emitter`` fixture defined
  in ``tests/sync/conftest.py``.  We borrow it via direct fixture request.
- Each parametrised case emits an assertion with a clear surface name so
  a regression immediately identifies the offending payload.
