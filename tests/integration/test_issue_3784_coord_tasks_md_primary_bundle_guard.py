"""Issue #3784 (FIXED) — permanent guard: a ``.worktrees/`` coord-surface path
(``tasks.md``) must never reach a PRIMARY-surface ``safe_commit`` bundle on a
coord-topology mission.

WHAT WAS REPORTED (now fixed)
-----------------------------
On a coord-topology mission (``meta.json`` ``topology: "coord"``,
``"flattened": false``, coordination worktree at ``.worktrees/<slug>-coord/``),
a lane transition's own auto-commit of the WP prompt file was refused with::

    safe_commit: refusing to stage path under .worktrees/:
    .worktrees/<slug>-coord/kitty-specs/<slug>/tasks.md.
    Planning artifacts must be committed from the coordination worktree,
    not the primary repo root.

The lane transition itself succeeded (the status event landed on the coordination
branch); only the primary-surface auto-commit was lost, leaving a dirty tree —
violating the "the tool drives the commits" contract.

ROOT CAUSE (fixed on this branch)
---------------------------------
``_collect_status_artifacts(feature_dir)``
(``src/specify_cli/cli/commands/agent/tasks_materialization.py``) returns THREE
existing artifacts: ``status.events.jsonl``, ``status.json``, AND ``tasks.md``.
On coord topology ``feature_dir`` is the coordination worktree
(``.worktrees/<slug>-coord/kitty-specs/<slug>/``), so ``tasks.md`` is a
``.worktrees/`` path.

The primary-surface claim-commit caller,
``src/specify_cli/cli/commands/implement.py`` (``_commit_wp_claim_status``),
bundles those artifacts for a ``safe_commit`` executed with
``worktree_root = repo_root``. It used to drop only the coord-owned STATUS_STATE
files with ``is_status_state_path`` (matching EXACTLY ``status.events.jsonl`` /
``status.json``) and NOT ``tasks.md`` (a ``TASKS_INDEX`` kind) — so ``tasks.md``
survived the filter into the bundle and tripped ``SafeCommitPathPolicyError``.

THE FIX
-------
``implement._primary_surface_status_paths`` now drops ANY ``.worktrees/``-nested
path on coord topology (``is_status_state_path(path) or
is_under_worktrees_segment(path)``), keeping the #2155 invariant whole: NO
``.worktrees/``-nested path may enter a primary-root ``safe_commit`` bundle.
Dropping the coord-worktree ``tasks.md`` from the CLAIM commit is correct — at
claim time it is unchanged and the primary copy was already committed at finalize.

This guard drives the REAL ``_do_move_task`` entry point (the #2939 coord-topology
harness) and the REAL ``_collect_status_artifacts`` / product
``_primary_surface_status_paths`` filter / ``safe_commit`` production surfaces —
no stubbed router, no patched resolver. GREEN today (defect fixed); it fails again
only if the coord ``.worktrees/`` exclusion regresses.

PROVENANCE NOTE (squad correction): step (a)/(b) below feed
``_collect_status_artifacts`` the COORD ``feature_dir`` directly to force a
``.worktrees/``-nested ``tasks.md`` into the candidate list and exercise the
``is_under_worktrees_segment`` filter clause. The live production caller,
``implement._commit_wp_claim_status``, never does this: ``implement()``
resolves its own ``feature_dir`` via
``placement_seam(repo_root, mission_slug).read_dir(MissionArtifactKind.SPEC)``
— a PRIMARY-partition kind that is topology-blind and never returns the coord
worktree (the #2453 coord-husk-shadows-primary fix) — so
``_collect_status_artifacts`` is never invoked on a coord directory through
that sole call path, and the ``is_under_worktrees_segment`` clause is
defensive there, not reachable. This test exercises the filter helper in
isolation over a genuinely coord-sourced artifact list (still built from real
production functions, no stubs) — it does NOT reconstruct the live caller's
own inputs.
