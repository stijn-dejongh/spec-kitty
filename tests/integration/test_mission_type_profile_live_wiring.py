"""Live-wiring integration test for mission-type governance profiles.

This is the FR-011 / journey-4 contract gate for WP08 cycle 2.  The cycle-1
ATDD spec at ``tests/missions/test_mission_type_profile_resolution.py``
exercised ``charter.mission_type_profiles.resolve_mission_type_governance``
in isolation, which proved the loader/resolver was *correct in a sandbox*
but did NOT prove a real documentation mission flowing through the
implement-prompt pipeline avoids the ``software-dev-default`` leak.

That gap is what this test closes.  It stages a fixture mission whose
``meta.json`` declares ``mission_type: documentation`` (no
project-level ``selected_*`` overrides) and invokes the production
prompt-build entry point — :func:`runtime.next.prompt_builder._build_wp_prompt` —
with ``action="implement"``.  The resulting prompt text MUST NOT contain
``software-dev-default``, proving the mission-type resolver fires inline
during prompt assembly rather than the implementer-agent silently
inheriting software-dev governance.

If a future refactor strips the
``resolve_mission_type_governance(repo_root, feature_dir)`` call from
``_build_wp_prompt``, this test goes red and pins the regression
immediately.

See:
* ``kitty-specs/charter-mediated-doctrine-selection-01KRTZCA/tasks/WP08-mission-type-profiles.md``
  → T046 ("Wire resolve_governance into the mission-context pipeline").
* ``kitty-specs/charter-mediated-doctrine-selection-01KRTZCA/tasks/WP08-mission-type-profiles/review-cycle-1.md``
  for the rejection rationale that prompted this test.

## Purpose

A minimal charter used by the WP08 mission-type-profile live-wiring
integration test.  The charter deliberately declares NO
``template_set`` so the resolver MUST source its mission-type defaults
from the documentation governance profile rather than silently falling
back to ``software-dev-default``.

## Technical Standards

Markdown, Sphinx, MkDocs.
