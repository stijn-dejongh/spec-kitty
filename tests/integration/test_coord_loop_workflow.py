"""Integration tests for WP04: workflow.py loop reads routed to planning seam.

Per-site RED-first tests proving the coord-topology routing invariant for each
routed site in ``workflow.py`` and the backward-compatible signature split in
``discovery.py``:

- **PRIMARY leg**: ``tasks/`` and ``lanes.json`` are read from the PRIMARY checkout.
- **STATUS leg**: event-log reads stay on the coord husk (C-001 per-leg split).
- **C-008**: review-cycle sub-artifacts (``baseline-tests.json``, sub_artifact_dir)
  stay on the coord-aware resolver.
- **Flat neutrality**: ``selection_reason`` is unchanged on a flat topology.
- **Backward-compat**: existing single-arg callers of ``preview_claimable_wp``
  keep working; the split is additive only.

RED-first proof (documented inline per site): before WP04, the routed sites used
coord-aware resolvers (``candidate_feature_dir_for_mission``,
``resolve_feature_dir_for_mission``) for ``tasks/`` and ``lanes.json`` reads.  The
coord husk carries NO ``tasks/`` directory and NO ``lanes.json`` — STATUS-only
invariant — so each command would fail (wrong lane, "no tasks", "unknown" context)
when the session topology is ``coord``.  After WP04,
``resolve_planning_read_dir(kind=WORK_PACKAGE_TASK/LANE_STATE)`` routes the
PRIMARY leg to the primary checkout, preserving the STATUS leg on the coord-aware
resolver (C-001 mixed-read discipline).

Fixture layout (from ``coord_topology_mission``):

* ``primary_feature_dir/``      — meta.json, tasks/WP01.md, lanes.json, DECOY events
* ``coord_feature_dir/``        — status.events.jsonl ONLY (coord marker)
* ``status_events_path``        — coord husk authoritative events file
* ``decoy_events_path``         — primary DECOY events file (distinct content)

The fixture coord events file initially has unparseable events (string evidence).
Tests that need parseable events write valid JSONL to ``ctx.status_events_path``
before invoking the subject under test.

See ``tests/integration/coord_topology_fixture.py`` for fixture details.

class TestReviewCommandRoutesGraphToPrimary:
    """T018: review command's build_dependency_graph routes tasks/ to PRIMARY.

    C-008 invariant: baseline-tests.json and sub_artifact_dir stay on the
    coord-aware ``resolve_feature_dir_for_mission`` resolver — they are
    review-cycle sub-artifacts that MUST be co-located with status on coord.

    RED-first proof:
    Before WP04, the review command used
    ``resolve_feature_dir_for_mission(repo_root, slug)`` for ``build_dependency_graph``,
    which for a coord-topology mission resolves to the coord husk (no tasks/ → empty
    graph → ``get_dependents`` returns no dependents → no warning generated even if
    dependents exist).

    After WP04: ``resolve_planning_read_dir(kind=WORK_PACKAGE_TASK)`` routes to
    PRIMARY (tasks/ present → real graph computed).

    Test strategy: rather than driving the full review CLI command (which needs git
    worktrees, review prompts, etc.), we verify the routing seam directly by asserting
    that:
    1. Pre-fix: ``build_dependency_graph(coord_husk)`` raises or returns empty
       (no tasks/ on husk → no WP files → empty graph).
    2. Post-fix (seam): ``build_dependency_graph(primary_dir)`` reads real tasks.
