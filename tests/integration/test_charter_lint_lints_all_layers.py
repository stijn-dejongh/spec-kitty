"""Charter-lint lints all three layers ATDD (Slice F WP06).

FR-003 binding: ``spec-kitty charter lint`` SHALL lint all configured
DRG layers in a single invocation; per-layer findings include the
layer's source name.

This file pins the operator-observable CLI surface: invoking
``spec-kitty charter lint`` in a repo with an org pack configured
produces output that names each layer (``built-in``, ``org:<pack_name>``,
``project``) and attributes findings (or the OK marker) to that source.
