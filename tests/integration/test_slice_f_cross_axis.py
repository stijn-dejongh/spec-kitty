"""Cross-axis integration: Slice F Axis 1 + Axis 2 + Axis 3 together.

FR-300 (broader): proves that the three Slice F axes interact correctly in a
single fixture — an org pack contributes DRG fragments (Axis 1), a monorepo
has per-package CharterScope resolution (Axis 2), and a custom workflow
sequence drives the next-action planner (Axis 3).

The fixture combines:
  - An org pack with a DRG fragment (Axis 1: three-layer DRG)
  - A monorepo layout with two charter scopes (Axis 2: CharterScope)
  - A mission with a custom workflow_id (Axis 3: composable workflow)

All three axes must work together without interfering with each other.

covers: FR-300 (broader) — expected GREEN at: WP12 final commit
