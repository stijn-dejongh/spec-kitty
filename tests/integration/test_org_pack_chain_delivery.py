"""Org-pack chain-delivery verification, both classes (#3530 close).

Mission ``doctrine-drg-silent-drop-boundary-01M0PE7E`` WP05 / T022-T024,
requirements FR-011 (chain delivery) + FR-012 (misconfig fails loud),
contract C-IC5.

Two delivery classes and the enumerated fail-loud contrast:

* **Class-b (fragment-drop, this mission)** — ``test_class_b_*``. Built-in +
  the repo's own ``packs/internal`` (the canonical org shape: a
  ``drg/fragment.yaml`` and no root-level ``*.graph.yaml``). Every kind the
  internal pack declares (glossary pack, procedure, directive) and its
  ``refines`` edges must reach the consumer through the caller seam WP04 fixed
  (``executor.py`` threads ``org_fragments=load_org_drg(repo_root,
  strict=False)`` into ``load_validated_graph``). Before that fix a
  fragment-only pack was silently dropped on this dispatch path — the
  branch-named silent drop this mission closes.

* **Class-a (multi-org-pack fold)** — ``test_class_a_*``. Built-in + internal +
  a SECOND minimal org fixture (``tests/doctrine/fixtures/minimal_org_pack_2``).
  ``merge_three_layers`` iterates ALL fragments (``merge.py:1251``), so a single
  org pack proves only class-b; pinning that fragments PAST THE FIRST are folded
  (finding F10) requires >=2 org packs and an assertion that PACK #2's own
  distinctive node/edge reaches the merged graph. Provenance (``org:minimal-org-2``)
  is the load-bearing proof it came from pack #2 specifically, plus a negative
  control (absent when pack #2 is not registered).

* **Misconfig fails loud (enumerated, FR-012)** — ``test_misconfigured_*``.
  Three faults each RAISE (not warn) with a fault-naming message, contrasted
  with the honest "no graph" WARNING for a genuinely graphless root. The raises
  are asserted against the FAIL-LOUD load path (``load_org_drg`` /
  ``load_validated_graph`` -> ``merge_three_layers``), not the deliberately
  degrade-tolerant executor helper, which swallows a malformed optional org
  tier by design (see ``StepContractExecutor._load_org_fragments_degrading``).

G10 guard: both ``packs/internal`` and ``minimal_org_pack_2`` are
fragment/refines-only and carry NO governance-profile ``selected_*`` selection,
so WP03's org-tier governance guard has nothing to resolve. These tests assert
DELIVERY, not governance fail-loud (WP03's territory) — which is why WP05
depends only on WP04.
