"""Scope: regression test for concurrent test-venv fixture creation (FR-003, FR-004).

Verifies that parallel pytest invocations against the contract and architectural
suites complete without racing on .pytest_cache/spec-kitty-test-venv.  This
reproduces the race condition described in issue #986 when the file lock is absent,
and confirms it is absent when the lock is in place.
