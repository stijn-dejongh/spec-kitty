"""WP02 — the surface→filesystem translation seam (the true schema root).

Behavioural coverage for the ONE affirmative, stamped surface resolver
(``mission_runtime.resolve_artifact_surface``) and the ONE total member→path
translation (``mission_runtime.translate_surface``), against **un-stubbed** git
fixtures (NFR-008 — no resolver is patched here).

Three concerns, each pinned to a contract clause:

* **Totality / no phantom** (data-model.md "TopologySurface", contract C4): every
  ``TopologySurface`` member translates to a real location — a member the seam
  cannot locate would be a phantom, and this is the operator's resolvability
  signal. ``LANE`` / ``CONSOLIDATED`` / ``TEMP`` have no production caller yet, so
  the totality test IS what makes "declared with the seam, not before it" true.
* **Four CoordState answers** (contract C3 / GEC-3): ``DELETED`` raises,
  ``EMPTY`` / ``UNMATERIALIZED`` resolve primary + stamp PRIMARY, ``MATERIALIZED``
  resolves coord + stamp COORD, and flat resolves primary affirmatively (AH-2).
* **AH-1 read/write symmetry** (from #2874 — the one preservation invariant with
  no other acceptance signal in this mission): ``read_surface == write_surface``
  for every ``MissionArtifactKind``, and the seam's stamp agrees with that
  symmetric home.

Git/mission scaffolding is reused verbatim from ``test_placement_partition_
golden_path`` (do NOT duplicate the git primitives), mirroring
``tests/mission_runtime/test_coord_read_seam.py``.
