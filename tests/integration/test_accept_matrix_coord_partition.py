"""#2404 coord-topology characterization: acceptance-matrix.json across ALL
three write paths, locked closed end to end (FR-009, SC-003).

WP01 (``117d86a68``, ``commit_router.py::_group_files_by_partition``) closed
the #2404 defect *shape* at the seam: a mixed-partition batch committed under
ONE nominal ``kind`` no longer resolves every file to that kind's partition —
each file is reclassified via ``kind_for_mission_file`` and split into its own
commit. WP02 (``bede15843``, ``accept.py``) routed the accept-gate's own
residual commit through the same seam. What neither WP proves END TO END is
that ``acceptance-matrix.json`` — a COORD-partition kind
(``MissionArtifactKind.ACCEPTANCE_MATRIX`` stays in
``mission_runtime.artifacts._PLACEMENT_ARTIFACT_KINDS``; the WP explicitly did
NOT flip it to a PRIMARY kind, see ``tracer-design-decisions.md``) — actually
lands on the coordination surface and is read back FRESH by accept's own read
seam (``resolve_feature_dir_for_mission`` + ``read_acceptance_matrix``, the
exact two calls ``acceptance/__init__.py::_check_lane_gates`` makes) via each
of the three real production write paths:

1. ``spec-commit`` (``spec_commit_cmd.py::spec_commit_command``, T011)
2. ``finalize-tasks``'s commit phase (the ``kind=TASKS_INDEX`` batch that
   ALSO includes ``acceptance-matrix.json``,
   ``mission_finalize.py::_commit_finalize_artifacts``, T012)
3. ``accept``'s own residual commit
   (``accept.py::_commit_residual_acceptance_artifacts``, WP02, T013)

Build ON #2462's landed ``tests/integration/test_placement_partition_golden_
path.py`` (``_init_git_repo`` / ``_create_mission`` / ``_commit`` /
``_materialize_coord_worktree``) — reused verbatim below, NOT duplicated —
plus ``tests/lane_test_utils.py`` for a production-shaped ``lanes.json``
keyed on a REAL minted ``mission_id``/``mid8`` (the #2462 CI-fixture lesson:
a meta-less/empty-mid8 fixture now hard-fails loudly,
``CoordinationWorkspaceIdentityUnresolved``, #2091 M-1 — never a silent
fallback).

NFR-001 (critical): every assertion below pins the resolved coord dir against
``CoordinationWorkspace.resolve(...)`` — the SAME canonical materialiser
WP01's router uses to write — never a hand-rolled ``-coord`` husk path. This
is the "kind-CORRECT post-fix surface", not the stale kind-blind husk
Directive-041 forbids re-pinning.

    non-coord path the folded fix must not disturb).

    Approach (a) — pin the guard DIRECTLY (renata MEDIUM): a bare
    ``resolved == feature_dir`` assertion cannot distinguish guarded from
    unguarded, because for a SINGLE_BRANCH mission
    ``placement_seam(...).read_dir(ACCEPTANCE_MATRIX)`` collapses to the SAME
    primary ``feature_dir`` — the test would pass even if the
    ``routes_through_coordination`` short-circuit were deleted. Instead spy on
    ``mission_runtime.placement_seam`` (the helper resolves it via
    ``from mission_runtime import placement_seam`` at call time, so patching the
    package attribute is visible) and assert it is NEVER consulted: the guard
