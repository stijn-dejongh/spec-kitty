"""Behavioural contract for WP06 — post-consolidation verification seam.

Pins contract ``negative-invariant-provenance.md`` C6/C7, spec FR-004/FR-005, and
the data-model Result state machine's ``deferred_to_consolidation ->
confirmed_absent | still_present`` transition (``verified_surface_kind =
CONSOLIDATED``).

These are filesystem/``grep`` tests: a consolidated mission tree is materialised in
a temp dir, the acceptance matrix is written alongside it, and the deferred
invariant is re-judged against that tree. No git is shelled — the consolidation
commit is supplied as a ref string, exactly as a dispatched op would pass it — so
the suite carries only the ``integration`` marker (real subprocess ``grep`` +
filesystem), mirroring the WP04 provenance/deferral suite.

Fixtures use production-shaped identifiers (a real mission slug with its ULID
suffix, 40-hex refs, real ``TopologySurface`` values) so a shape assumption that
would break on real data breaks here.
