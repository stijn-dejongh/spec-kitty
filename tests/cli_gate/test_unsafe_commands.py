"""Unsafe-command matrix tests (WP08 / T033).

Verifies that the gate blocks unsafe commands against incompatible project
states with the correct exit codes:

  Exit 4 — BLOCK_PROJECT_MIGRATION  (stale project, unsafe command)
  Exit 5 — BLOCK_CLI_UPGRADE        (too-new project, unsafe command)
  Exit 6 — BLOCK_PROJECT_CORRUPT    (corrupt metadata, any command)

Tests invoke ``check_schema_version`` directly (not the full Typer app) to
keep the suite fast and focused on gate semantics.
