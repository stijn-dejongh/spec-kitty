"""Safe-command matrix tests (WP08 / T033).

Verifies that every command classified as SAFE in the compat.safety registry
exits 0 even against a ``fixture_project_too_new`` project (worst-case schema
mismatch).  The gate must NOT block safe commands regardless of schema state.

Design note: these tests invoke the gate function directly
(``check_schema_version``) rather than the full Typer app to avoid the heavy
bootstrap (``ensure_runtime``, etc.) and to keep tests fast.  The gate is the
relevant chokepoint for block decisions; the nag path is covered in
``test_ci_determinism.py``.
