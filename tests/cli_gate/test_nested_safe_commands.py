"""FIX 2 regression tests — nested safe agent commands not blocked under schema mismatch.

Before FIX 2, check_schema_version built the Invocation command_path from only
``ctx.invoked_subcommand`` (one token), so ``spec-kitty agent mission branch-context``
reached the planner as ``("agent",)`` which is NOT in SAFETY_REGISTRY, causing
a fail-closed UNSAFE → block even though the full path is explicitly registered.

After FIX 2, _build_command_path() reads sys.argv[1:] to produce the full path
tuple, and the safety registry correctly matches the nested safe commands.
