"""Regression test for RISK-5 (mission-review-v2): manifest coexistence.

The legacy `ManagedSkillManifest` writes to `.kittify/skills-manifest.json`
(tracking canonical skills like spec-kitty-runtime-next that the legacy
installer places under agent-specific roots like .claude/skills/).

The new `SkillsManifest` writes to `.kittify/command-skills-manifest.json`
(tracking the Spec Kitty command-skill packages that command_installer
places under .agents/skills/spec-kitty.<command>/).

These two manifests previously collided because both used the same filename
constant (`skills-manifest.json`). After renaming the new manifest, a
mixed install — one legacy-path agent + one skill-only agent — must yield
two distinct manifest files with their respective schemas intact. This
test is the guardrail that keeps the two systems from being merged back
into the same path by a future refactor.
