"""Surface-agreement regression for the ``spec-kitty analyze`` reconciliation (FR-011, #3096).

Background: #3096 reported that the ``spec-kitty.analyze`` skill directed
agents/operators to run a bare top-level ``spec-kitty analyze`` CLI command
that does not exist — only ``spec-kitty agent mission record-analysis`` does.
Investigation for this WP (charter-pack-usage-journey-01KYWWTF WP06) found the
canonical doctrine source (``src/doctrine/missions/mission-steps/software-dev/
analyze/prompt.md``, which ``command_renderer.py`` renders into every agent's
``SKILL.md``/command file) and the current doc corpus already redirect
exclusively to ``agent mission record-analysis`` — no textual fix was needed.
This test locks that state in as a regression guard, and pins the two-surface
distinction the fold called out explicitly:

* the **working** ``/spec-kitty.analyze`` skill / mission-step (invoked via
  the harness, backed by ``agent mission record-analysis``) — preserved;
* the **absent** top-level ``spec-kitty analyze`` CLI subcommand — must never
  be advertised as if it were real.

Do NOT extend this test to cover the ``analyze``-*expansion* issues
(#849/#851/#853 — readiness-review / product-coherence / full-corpus). Those
are separate scope.
