"""WP06 / T022 — SC-2 reproduction: the paused 01KTNWFC blockers do not reproduce.

The doctrine-glossary-architecture-consolidation mission (01KTNWFC) was paused by
two structural deadlocks (``work/MISSION_01KTNWFC_PAUSED.md``):

* **#1814** — ``record-analysis`` deadlocked on *coord residue*: the primary
  checkout of a coordination-topology mission legitimately carries stale copies
  of the coord-owned status log/snapshot, and the dirty-tree preflight counted
  that residue as an unsafe dirty working tree, so ``record-analysis`` could
  never run from the primary checkout.
* **#1816** — implement-claim blocked on a *planning-artifact branch-split*: the
  placement decision was derived independently from meta.json, so a flattened
  mission was mis-treated as a primary↔coord split.

WP06 resolves both by routing the placement decision through the context's
single :class:`CommitTarget` (the ``ArtifactPlacementFragment.placement_ref`` ==
``BranchRefFragment.destination_ref``, C-PLACE-1). These tests reproduce the two
blockers at the precise sites that deadlocked and assert they no longer do — the
checks are genuine (real ``git status`` residue / real porcelain entries), not
mocked away.
