"""Track B red-first (#4090): retrospect and ``doctor mission-state`` disagree.

Post-merge reader divergence. After a real ``spec-kitty merge`` of a coord
mission, two partitions survive for the same mission:

* the **PRIMARY** partition (``kitty-specs/<slug>/``) — the merged record: every
  WP terminal (``done``), and — matching what a real merge produces on HEAD —
  **NO ``merged_at`` marker** on ``meta.json`` (its writer was deleted in #2258
  and never re-added);
* a diverged **COORD husk** (``.worktrees/<slug>-coord/kitty-specs/<slug>/``) —
  the stale pre-merge surface: the same WPs still recorded ``approved`` (never
  ``done``), no merge marker.

Two REAL readers resolve that state differently:

* ``retrospect create``'s completion check
  (:func:`retrospect._check_mission_completed` →
  :func:`retrospect._canonical_events_path` →
  :func:`coordination.surface_resolver.resolve_status_surface`) routes through
  the primary-wins guard ``_primary_mission_is_completed`` →
  ``is_mission_merged`` → ``meta.get("merged_at")``. With ``merged_at`` ABSENT
  the guard is dormant, so the resolver falls to the ``.worktrees`` husk
  short-circuit and reads the **stale coord** surface → sees the WPs
  non-terminal (``approved``) → raises ``MISSION_NOT_COMPLETED``.
* ``doctor mission-state`` re-anchors to the canonical primary checkout
  (:func:`migration.mission_state._anchor_repair_root`) and its read engine
  (:func:`audit.engine.run_audit`) scans ``<root>/kitty-specs`` — the **PRIMARY**
  partition, structurally never the ``.worktrees`` husk — where all 11 WPs are
  terminal.

Before WP04 the two readers DISAGREED (11 open on the husk vs 0 open / 11 terminal
on primary). WP04's fix — restoring the ``merged_at`` writer + a reopen-aware
``is_mission_merged`` — re-arms the primary-wins guard, so retrospect resolves the
same authoritative primary surface the doctor already reads and both agree.

Scope note: this test **constructs** the post-merge state (it hardcodes the
``merged_at`` absence rather than running a real ``spec-kitty merge`` — C-003
forbids dogfooding the coord merge here), so it guards the **resolver-agreement
contract** across both real readers. The complementary writer-regression guard —
that a real merge actually stamps ``merged_at`` (the #2258 re-deletion guard) —
lives in ``tests/specify_cli/status/test_merged_at_writer_and_reopen_4090.py``.
Post-WP04 this test PASSES (the ``xfail`` marker was removed at the green-flip).
