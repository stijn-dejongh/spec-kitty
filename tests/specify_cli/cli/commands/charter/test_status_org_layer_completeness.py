"""``charter status`` must not hand out a clean bill for an incomplete graph.

WP08 re-review fold. The first fold wired
:func:`doctrine.drg.validate_dangling_references` into ONE of the callers that
merges the real built-in layer against the operator's real configured packs
(``doctor doctrine``'s JSON collector) and justified stopping there by calling
that caller "the one place that holds a graph it can call complete".

That was factually wrong. :func:`_collect_org_layer_status` builds its merged
graph from byte-identical inputs — ``load_built_in_graph()`` against
``load_org_drg(repo_root)`` — so it holds exactly the same complete graph. It
already ships an ``errors`` array built for precisely this kind of finding, and
before this fold it returned ``"errors": []`` for a pack whose edge endpoint
binds to nothing: a machine-readable clean bill for a graph that is not clean.
That is this mission's own defect class one layer up.

The rule that actually governs the check (now stated on
:func:`doctrine.drg.validator.validate_dangling_references`) is a predicate on
the *merge*, not a uniqueness claim about one call site: **a caller may escalate
a dangling endpoint to an error exactly when it merged the complete graph.**
``charter lint`` is the one caller that must NOT (it merges against a
deliberately EMPTY built-in, so the check genuinely cannot run there).

These tests mirror ``test_doctor_doctrine_org_layer`` ::

    test_collect_org_layer_data_reports_a_dangling_org_endpoint
    test_collect_org_layer_data_reports_no_dangling_endpoint_when_clean

including the clean discriminator — a gate that flags everything is worthless.
