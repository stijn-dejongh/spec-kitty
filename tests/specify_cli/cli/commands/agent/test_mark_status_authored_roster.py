"""``mark-status`` must resolve a subtask id the shipped template tells you to author.

Campsite fix for #2962, landed in-branch ahead of mission
``doctrine-silence-guards-01KYFV7Q``'s work packages because it blocks every one
of them.

The defect
----------
Since **#2816 IC-10 (FR-016 / SC-010)** subtask completion is *solely*
event-sourced, and the lane-transition guard sources its roster from the WP
frontmatter rather than from ``tasks.md``. :func:`authored_subtask_roster`'s own
docstring records why: *"Sourcing the roster from the frontmatter — not by
re-parsing tasks.md — is what makes checkbox removal safe."*

The shipped ``software-dev`` tasks template was updated to match, and now tells
authors:

    Subtasks are **reference rows**, not checkboxes … there is no ``- [ ]`` box
    to tick.

``mark-status`` was not updated. It resolves an id through four legacy shapes —
``- [ ] T001``, a pipe-table row, an inline ``Subtasks: T001, T002`` list, or a
bare ``WPxx`` — and a ``tasks.md`` authored exactly as the template instructs
(``T001 <description>`` beneath an ``### Included Subtasks`` heading) matches
none of them. Every id reports ``NOT_FOUND``, so no subtask can be marked, so
``move-task --to for_review`` blocks on subtasks that can never be checked, and
``--force`` becomes the only way through **on every WP of every mission using
this template**.

That is the failure this repository keeps having: two canonical surfaces that
disagree, with the disagreement invisible until someone follows the documented
one literally.

The fix
-------
A fifth resolver that consults the **authored ``subtasks:`` frontmatter roster** —
the same source the guard already treats as canonical static intent. It is added
*after* the four legacy resolvers, so every existing format keeps resolving
exactly as before; this is additive, not a replacement.
