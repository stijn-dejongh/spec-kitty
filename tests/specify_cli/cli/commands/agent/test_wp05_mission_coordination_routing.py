"""WP05 / T027 — mission.py routes the 2 decision sites through ``routes_through_coordination`` (FR-005 / FR-001b).

The two coord-routing decision sites in ``mission.py`` read the WP01
``routes_through_coordination(resolve_topology(...))`` predicate over the STORED
topology — never a per-ref ``CommitTarget.kind`` (the retired arm, FR-001b):

* ``_planning_commit_worktree`` — decides whether the commit runs in the coord
  worktree vs the main checkout.
* ``_enforce_analysis_report_write_preflight`` — decides whether to drop
  coord-artifact residue from the dirty set.

Behaviour must be byte-equivalent for already-correct topologies (NFR-003): a
coord-less topology keeps the main checkout / does not drop residue; a coord
topology routes through coordination. An AST gate pins that zero
``.kind is COORDINATION`` *decision* reads remain.
