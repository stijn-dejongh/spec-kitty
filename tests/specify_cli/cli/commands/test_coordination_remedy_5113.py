"""#5113 / FR-014: every unmaterialized-coordination remedy is truthful.

Round-trip proof: for every emitter classified as *unmaterialized*
(branch present, worktree absent — never deleted/never-created, never
husk/EMPTY), the ``spec-kitty …`` command the emitted text names is extracted
via one shared regex, run through its real entry point, and asserted to leave
the coordination worktree materialized. Guards against any of these emitters
naming ``spec-kitty doctor workspaces --fix``, which only removes husks and
CANNOT create a worktree (#2240) -- the named command must actually
materialize the worktree, not merely run cleanly while it stays absent.

Classification:

* ``surface_resolver`` (``CoordinationWorktreeUnmaterialized.next_step``)
  — unmaterialized. IN this round trip.
* ``doctor coordination`` finding (``COORDINATION_WORKTREE_MISSING``) —
  unmaterialized by construction (that is the finding's whole purpose). IN.
* ``runtime_bridge`` (``_resolve_wp_board_action``'s ``CoordinationWorktree
  Unmaterialized`` arm) — unmaterialized. IN. The sibling
  ``CoordinationBranchDeleted`` arm is a DIFFERENT (deleted) classification
  and is NOT a case here (it now surfaces its own flatten-guidance
  ``next_step`` instead of "Materialize it" — see ``test_bridge_parity.py``).
* ``write_target_degrade.assert_coord_write_materialized`` — ONE arm reaches
  this raise: remote-only (branch not a local head — a MULTI-STEP remedy,
  exercised separately below, not in this parametrized round trip). The
  sibling arm -- a STALE local head (branch present, worktree absent) -- used
  to also refuse here, but **re-pinned deliberately**
  (coord-artifact-single-home-01M3V4BE WP03, research D22): the gate is now a
  thin delegate to the single write authority
  (``specify_cli.coordination.coord_seed.establish_coord_write_location``),
  which self-materializes a local head regardless of committed content
  instead of refusing it. See
  ``test_write_target_degrade_local_head_self_materializes`` below (NOT in
  this round trip, since it no longer raises and has no remedy text to
  extract).
* ``implement_cores.py::_resolve_placement_ref`` (consumed by
  ``implement()`` at the real ``_resolve_placement_ref(repo_root,
  mission_slug=..., wp_id=...)`` call site) routes through
  :func:`~mission_runtime.resolve_action_context`, whose status-surface leg
  resolves with ``for_write=False`` (the READ shape) — so it genuinely
  raises/degrades-to-``None`` for BOTH the unmaterialized AND the deleted/
  never-created classification. IN this round trip, called directly (the
  real production resolver, on a real fresh unmaterialized Mission) rather
  than through the full ``spec-kitty implement`` CLI, which additionally
  needs a seeded ``lanes.json``/task board unrelated to this remedy.
* ``mission_record_analysis.py::_resolve_record_analysis_placement_ref`` —
  investigated and found NOT reachable in the unmaterialized state: it
  resolves via ``placement_seam(...).write_target(...)`` ->
  ``resolve_placement_only(..., for_write=True)``, and the WRITE-shaped
  status-surface leg (``resolve_status_surface_with_anchor``) composes the
  coord path DIRECTLY for ``UNMATERIALIZED`` instead of raising (only
  ``DELETED`` still hard-fails there). So this site's ``placement_ref is
  None`` branch is deleted/never-created ONLY — NOT a case here (confirmed by
  running it directly: the dirty-tree preflight, not
  ``PlacementResolutionRequired``, was what actually fired). Its remedy text
  is corrected for the deleted/never-created command and pinned by
  ``test_record_analysis_placement.py``.
* ``implement.py``'s own inline ``PlacementResolutionRequired`` raise (inside
  ``_commit_planning_artifacts_transaction``, the known SC-002 duplicate of
  ``_resolve_claim_commit_target``) raises the byte-identical text (proven by
  ``test_implement_writeside.py``) via the SAME
  ``doctor coordination --fix`` command already round-trip-proven by the
  ``doctor_finding`` case above, so a second full-CLI round trip through it
  would exercise the identical fixer a second time without covering any new
  remedy text or command.
