"""Composition tests for the five `research` mission step contracts.

This file mirrors ``test_software_dev_composition.py`` but at the substrate
level: it asserts the four pieces that the mission-composition runtime needs
in order to dispatch a `research/<action>` invocation actually line up:

1. The shipped step contract for each research action loads through
   :class:`MissionStepContractRepository`.
2. ``_ACTION_PROFILE_DEFAULTS`` carries the agreed default profile for each
   `("research", action)` pair.
3. Each action's doctrine bundle (``src/doctrine/missions/research/actions/
   <action>/index.yaml``) exists and parses to non-empty governance content.
4. The merged DRG resolves a non-empty governance context for each
   `action:research/<action>` URN at the same depth the composer uses.
5. Sentinel: the existing ``software-dev`` profile-default entries were not
   touched while adding the research entries.

These tests intentionally read the live shipped DRG via
``charter._drg_helpers.load_validated_graph`` and the production resolver
``doctrine.drg.query.resolve_context`` (mission spec C-007 forbids mocking
either surface). The composer's higher-level dispatch surfaces
(``_dispatch_via_composition``, ``StepContractExecutor.execute``,
``ProfileInvocationExecutor.invoke``, ``_load_frozen_template``) are also
not mocked here -- this gate proves the *substrate* is wired, not dispatch.
