"""Regression parity test: twelve non-migrated agents produce stable output.

Asserts that the command-file renderer produces byte-identical output to the
committed baseline under ``_twelve_agent_baseline/`` for every agent in
``AGENT_COMMAND_CONFIG`` (the twelve agents whose command-delivery mechanism
was not changed by mission 083-agent-skills-codex-vibe).

Codex, Vibe, Pi, and Letta are intentionally excluded — they use the Agent
Skills pipeline (``tests/specify_cli/skills/__snapshots__/`` covers them).

Baseline note
-------------
This baseline was captured post-mission-083 (after WP01–WP06), not from a
pre-mission checkout.  Pre-vs-post byte-identity is infeasible because WP02
edited source templates, changing rendered output for all agents.  The
baseline locks in post-mission state; future unintended drift is caught here.

Regenerating
------------
When a template change is intentional::

    PYTEST_UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 pytest tests/specify_cli/regression/ -v

Commit the updated baseline files alongside the template change.

TODO (reconsider this test's design if it keeps causing friction):
    This guard pins *byte-identical* rendered output for 12 agents, so ANY
    legitimate one-line prose edit to a doctrine source prompt
    (``src/doctrine/missions/mission-steps/**``) forces regenerating ~12
    baseline files, none of which the reviewer reads. The baseline asserts
    byte-identity, not semantic correctness — it catches accidental drift but
    also fires loudly on every intended change, and the large mechanical diff
    can bury the actual source change. If this churn becomes a recurring tax
    (observed: primary/merge terminology sweep, mission primary-merge-vocabulary
    -01KXP11C T009), reconsider: e.g. assert structural invariants + a single
    canonical-agent snapshot rather than a full 12-agent byte grid, or derive
    the per-agent expectation from the source template instead of a frozen copy.
