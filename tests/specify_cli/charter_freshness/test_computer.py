"""Unit tests for ``specify_cli.charter_runtime.freshness.computer``
(WP02 / FR-005, FR-009; re-pointed at ``charter.yaml`` by
consolidate-charter-bundle WP06 / FR-003, FR-011, NFR-001, NFR-002).

Covers each documented sub-state:

* ``fresh`` — ``charter.yaml`` exists and parses (``charter_source`` /
  ``synced_bundle``); the synthesis manifest's stored ``bundle_content_hash``
  matches a fresh recompute (``synthesized_drg``).
* ``stale`` — ``synthesized_drg`` only: the stored hash diverges from a
  fresh recompute, or the upstream ``synced_bundle`` is not itself fresh.
  ``charter_source`` NEVER returns ``stale`` post-Landmine-2 (the
  ``charter.md``-hash staleness mechanism is retired outright — see
  ``computer.py``'s module docstring).
* ``missing`` — when the synthesized DRG file is absent and the manifest
  does not opt into ``built_in_only=true`` (or ``charter.yaml`` itself is
  absent, for ``charter_source``/``synced_bundle``).
* ``built_in_only`` — when the manifest declares ``built_in_only: true``.
  A residual ``graph.yaml`` the manifest disowns is *stale graph residue*
  (FR-006 / C2-f): still ``built_in_only`` + a non-blocking diagnostic, never
  the formerly-terminal ``invalid`` state.
* ``invalid`` — a genuine inconsistency from ``_compute_charter_source``:
  ``charter.yaml`` exists but cannot be parsed. (No ``synthesized_drg``
  producer returns ``invalid`` after FR-006.)
