"""#2650 (WP04) -- FR-006 characterization gate.

Pins the CURRENT (as of this WP) behavior of the three partition-decision
sites named in ``data-model.md``'s table, BEFORE any consolidation swap of
``commit_router``'s classifier onto the shared residue predicate (that swap
is WP05's job, T024). This gate is a live snapshot, not a design spec -- if a
future change makes any assertion here false, that is a signal the change
touched one of these three named sites and must be evaluated against the
unified-authority contract in ``contracts/partition-authority-and-warning.md``.

The three sites:

* Read  -- ``implement_cores.py::resolve_precondition_ref``
* Write -- ``implement.py::_partition_files_for_commit``
* Write -- ``coordination/commit_router.py::_group_files_by_partition``

Both cli-side sites (read + write in ``implement.py``/``implement_cores.py``)
already delegate to the shared
``mission_runtime.is_coordination_artifact_residue_path`` predicate (WP01/
WP02, prior WPs in this lane) -- they already route ``kind=None`` paths
(``meta.json``, unrecognized) to PRIMARY, and this WP additionally unifies
the concrete REF value they resolve to (FR-005 ref half; see
``test_precondition_ref_unification.py``). ``commit_router``'s
``_group_files_by_partition`` instead classifies via
``kind_for_mission_file(file) or kind`` -- falling back to the CALLER's
partition (which can be COORD) for a ``kind=None`` path. That fallback is the
#2533-class hole: it is NOT touched by this WP (boundary: ``commit_router.py``
is WP05's surface) -- it is only characterized/pinned here so WP05 has one
gate to swap against.
