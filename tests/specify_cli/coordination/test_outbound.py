"""SaaS-sink fanout deferral tests (T041, FR-022, NFR-009, SC-09).

Covers the two critical paths:

1. **Success path**: ``queue_saas_emission`` registers the emission;
   ``BookkeepingTransaction.commit`` succeeds; deferred outbound runs
   and the sink receives the event.
2. **Rollback path**: ``queue_saas_emission`` registers the emission;
   ``BookkeepingTransaction.commit`` fails (forced); rollback runs;
   the sink receives **zero** events (NFR-009 / SC-09).

The forced-failure path uses a pre-commit hook that rejects every
commit — the same mechanism #1348 used to expose the bug, so the test
is faithful to the real-world failure mode.
