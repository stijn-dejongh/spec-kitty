"""WP02 — Status-facade adoption regression tests.

Two binding regressions are covered here (execution-context-unification-01KTPKST):

* **F-007 / #1737** — ``status_transition._identity_for_request`` must consume
  the canonical status surface (``resolve_status_surface`` /
  ``candidate_feature_dir_for_mission``) instead of re-deriving where status
  lives from a CWD-dependent path. A sparse lane worktree must therefore resolve
  the *same* WP lane state as the primary checkout — no ``genesis`` misread.

* **#1357** — ``CoordinationWorkspace.resolve`` must be lock-serialized so that
  two concurrent resolves of the same coordination worktree cannot both pass the
  ``not path.exists()`` guard and race ``git worktree add`` into divergent
  surfaces.
