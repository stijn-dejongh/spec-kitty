"""Partition-aware ``commit_for_mission`` seam (WP01 / FR-007 / C-006).

``commit_for_mission`` resolved ONE placement for the WHOLE file batch via a
single ``resolve_placement_only(kind=kind)`` call (``commit_router.py:152``).
Any caller that passes a mixed-partition batch under one ``kind`` misrouted
every file to that kind's partition — the root of #2404: ``spec_commit_cmd.py``
(``kind=SPEC``) and ``mission_finalize.py`` (``kind=TASKS_INDEX``) both commit
COORD artifacts (``acceptance-matrix.json`` / ``issue-matrix.md`` / ``status.*``)
to the PRIMARY branch, so ``accept`` reads a stale coord copy.

This module pins the fix at the SEAM (contracts/partition-aware-commit-seam.md):

* RED-1 — a batch mixing a PRIMARY file (``tasks.md``) and a COORD file
  (``acceptance-matrix.json``) under ``kind=TASKS_INDEX`` must land each file on
  its OWN partition's ref (INV-C1). Proven RED against the pre-fix single-call
  code (both files land on the PRIMARY ref).
* RED-2 — a batch containing a ``None``-classified file (unrecognised path, e.g.
  ``gap-analysis.md``) under ``kind=SPEC`` must still commit — via the
  caller-``kind`` fallback — never dropped, never coerced into the wrong
  partition. This is the regression guard for a naive per-file rewrite that
  filters ``kind_f is not None`` and silently drops the unclassified file.
* Fast path — a genuinely single-partition batch (the common case: every real
  caller today) commits via ONE ``resolve_placement_only`` call and ONE
  ``safe_commit`` call, byte-identical to the pre-fix code path.
