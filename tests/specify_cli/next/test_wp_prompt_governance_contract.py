"""ATDD acceptance spec: WP prompt governance completeness contract.

These tests are the executable specification for the next mission. They
encode the contract that:

1. `spec-kitty agent action implement` (and `... review`) build the WP prompt
   from a command template AND invoke the charter/doctrine pipeline to fetch
   governance content.
2. The fetched content is **amended into** the WP prompt — either as
   **verbatim rule bodies** for the directives, tactics, glossary terms,
   and ADR entries that govern the action, OR as **explicit fetch commands
   paired with a "when doing X, run …" conditional rule** so the executing
   agent can pull the body on demand.
3. The loaded agent profile's `directive-references` and `tactic-references`
   (e.g. python-pedro citing DIRECTIVE_010, reviewer-renata citing
   DIRECTIVE_032) MUST surface in the prompt — either by ID + content or by
   fetch command. Today these are loaded into the profile object but never
   rendered in the prompt; that gap is the structural cause of the
   shipped → built-in / provenance → source-attribution drift documented in
   `docs/development/org-doctrine-layer-architecture-review.md`.
4. The compact governance lookup (`spec-kitty charter context --action
   implement`) must surface section bodies, not only anchors, for sections
   the action depends on (Terminology Canon, Code Review Checklist,
   Regression Vigilance, etc.).
5. The runtime implement template at
   `src/specify_cli/missions/software-dev/command-templates/implement.md`
   currently includes a forbid clause that says "do not separately call
   `spec-kitty charter context` …". Either that clause must be removed
   (and the prompt augmented to carry the rule bodies), or the template
   must explicitly declare which governance bodies are guaranteed to be in
   the prompt and which require a fetch.
6. The two directive namespaces — charter-extracted `DIR-NNN` (auto-emitted
   by `spec-kitty charter sync` into `.kittify/charter/directives.yaml`)
   and doctrine-catalog `DIRECTIVE_NNN` (hand-authored in
   `src/doctrine/directives/built-in/*.directive.yaml`) — must be
   cross-linked when one cites the other, so the resolver can surface the
   right body regardless of which ID the citation used.

These tests will fail today (the current implementation injects only
section anchors with the wrong directive namespace and zero tactics).
That failure is the spec for the next mission. Do not modify the tests
to make them pass via mocks; modify the implementation.

Background: the root-cause analysis lives at
`docs/development/org-doctrine-layer-architecture-review.md`, sections
"Process architecture: where the glossary / architecture alignment failed",
"Root cause", and "Empirical addendum".

_MINIMAL_CHARTER_MD = """\
# Test Project Charter

> Version: 1.0.0

## Purpose

A minimal charter used by the WP-prompt governance contract acceptance
tests. The body of this charter intentionally declares both a
``template_set`` and an ``available_tools`` selection so the resolved
charter context surfaces those declarations instead of falling back to
``software-dev-default`` with a diagnostics warning.

## Technical Standards

Python 3.11+, pytest, mypy strict.

## Terminology Canon

- The canonical term for a unit of governed work is **Mission**.
- ``feature`` and ``features`` are prohibited in canonical, operator, and
  user-facing language; legacy aliases are permitted only as hidden
  secondary CLI flags.

## Regression Vigilance (2026-04-06)

When renaming any identifier-bearing term (e.g. shipped → built-in,
provenance → source-attribution), the reviewer MUST grep the diff for the
old term, MUST consult the project glossary at ``docs/context/``,
and MUST flag any unconverted occurrence as a defect.

## Code Review Checklist

- The WP diff respects the agent profile's directive-references.
- Terminology in code and docs aligns with the project glossary
  (DIRECTIVE_032 — Conceptual Alignment).
- No new code path violates an architectural ADR in
  ``docs/adr/3.x/``.

## Charter Resolution Hints

template_set: software-dev-default
available_tools: [git, spec-kitty, pytest, mypy, ruff]
