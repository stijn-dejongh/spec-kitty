"""Behavior tests for the Lane sentinel consumers touched by #2675 (WP06).

WP05 promoted ``Lane.UNINITIALIZED`` to a real ``Lane`` StrEnum member, so
``Lane("uninitialized")`` now *succeeds* where it used to raise
``ValueError``. Several consumers had an ``except ValueError`` (or an
equality comparison against the pre-WP05 raw string sentinel) that silently
relied on that failure to mean "unseeded WP" -- those branches go dead once
WP05 lands, and every consumer already ``str(...)``-coerces the lane before
comparing it, so ``mypy`` cannot see the resulting behavior change. Only a
behavior test can.

Primary targets (these ACTUALLY FLIP after WP05 if the consumer isn't
updated -- the red-first spine; see the class module docstrings below for
the live-repro proof each test encodes):

1. ``done_bookkeeping._resolve_lane_with_planned_fallback`` (site-1): the
   ``except ValueError`` used to return ``(coord_lane, False)``; the ``try``
   now succeeds and would return ``(Lane.UNINITIALIZED, True)`` --
   flipping the force-done flag ``False -> True``.
2. ``coordination.status_transition.read_current_wp_state_transactional``
   (~:557): the ``except (ValueError, ...)`` used to return
   ``(Lane.GENESIS, None)``; the ``try`` now succeeds and would return
   ``(Lane.UNINITIALIZED, None)`` instead.

Secondary characterization (already correct both before AND after WP05 --
NOT the red-first spine, included for completeness):

3. ``core.worktree_topology._read_canonical_lane_or_default`` maps an
   unseeded WP to ``"planned"`` (StrEnum equality already covered this).
4. ``merge.done_bookkeeping._assert_merged_wps_reached_done`` (site-2)
   still treats an unseeded WP as NOT done (``Lane.UNINITIALIZED !=
   Lane.DONE``).
