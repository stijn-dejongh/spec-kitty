"""Global consistency guard for packaged mission prompt templates.

Every step in a packaged ``mission-runtime.yaml`` declares a ``prompt_template``
(or ``None``). At runtime, ``spec-kitty next`` resolves that template one of two
ways:

1. **Composition-driven** -- the step's action is dispatched through
   ``StepContractExecutor`` composition (via ``charter.resolve_action_sequence``).
   These steps never read a file from ``command-templates/``; the built-in step
   contracts under ``src/doctrine/missions/built_in_step_contracts/`` are
   authoritative, and prompt templates live under
   ``src/doctrine/missions/mission-steps/{mission}/{step}/prompt.md``.
2. **Legacy CLI-driven** -- the step's action falls through to
   ``prompt_builder._build_template_prompt`` which calls
   ``resolve_command(f"{action}.md", ..., mission=<mission>)``.

FR-010 (charter-doctrine-mission-type-configuration-01KSWJVX): all command
templates were migrated verbatim from ``src/specify_cli/missions/*/command-templates/``
to ``src/doctrine/missions/mission-steps/``. The old ``command-templates/``
directories are deleted. The upgrade migration pipeline (which deploys agent
command files) is rewired to the new doctrine path. The ``spec-kitty next``
runtime resolver for non-composed steps is a known follow-up tracked separately.

Steps that are NOT yet routed through composition but whose templates exist in
the doctrine layer must be added to ``KNOWN_CLI_DRIVEN`` so the gap is explicit
and not silent.
