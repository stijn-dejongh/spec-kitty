"""Behavior-driven coverage for ``specify_cli.core.file_lock``.

Supplements ``tests/core/test_file_lock.py`` with:
- acquire/release happy path (synced with existing suite)
- timeout branch (short deadline → LockAcquireTimeout raised)
- corrupt-lock-file recovery (read_lock_record returns None)
- contention via multiprocessing (marked slow; serialization invariant)

Tactic: function-over-form-testing (src/doctrine/tactics/shipped/testing/).
Structure: AAA (Arrange / Act / Assert).
