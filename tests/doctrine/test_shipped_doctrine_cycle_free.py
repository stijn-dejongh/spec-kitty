"""Integration test: shipped doctrine artifacts must form a cycle-free reference graph.

This test exercises the actual resolution entrypoint (``resolve_references_transitively``)
against the full set of shipped doctrine artifacts loaded through the real
``DoctrineService``. It provides a build-time guarantee that no cycle exists in
the shipped artifact set — catching misconfiguration before it reaches users.

Unlike ``test_directive_consistency.py::test_tactic_reference_graph_has_no_cycles``
(which inspects raw YAML files directly), this test goes through the exact same
``DoctrineService`` + ``_Walker`` code path that runs at execution time, so it
also validates that the resolution infrastructure itself handles the shipped set
correctly.

Not marked ``@pytest.mark.fast`` because it performs filesystem I/O (reads shipped
YAML files). It runs in the default (non-fast) pytest sweep and in CI.
