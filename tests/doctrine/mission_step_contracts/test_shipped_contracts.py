"""Acceptance tests: shipped MissionStepContracts for software-dev are valid and complete.

These tests verify:
1. All 4 software-dev actions have shipped step contracts
2. Every step contract passes model validation
3. Delegates-to references point to valid ArtifactKind values
4. Step IDs are unique within each contract
5. Contracts are loadable via DoctrineService
6. Round-trip serialization preserves all fields
