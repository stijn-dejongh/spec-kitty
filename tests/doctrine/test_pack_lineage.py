"""Tests for the data-only pack-lineage adapter (FR-006, FR-007, WP03).

Covers :mod:`specify_cli.doctrine.pack_lineage`: the ``pack_id -> resolvable
key`` adapter that feeds ``org_extends.resolve_extends_order`` (no second
walker, C-002/NFR-001), fail-closed rejection of unresolvable
``parent_pack``/``accompanies_doctrine_pack`` edges, and the FR-007 positive
read-back for ``accompanies_doctrine_pack``.

All fixtures are plain in-memory dicts (``pack_id -> name`` / ``pack_id ->
parent pack_id``) -- this lane is decoupled from sibling work packages'
``PackDescriptor``/``PackManifest`` types (lane independence; see module
docstring in ``pack_lineage.py``).
