"""No :class:`NodeKind` may vanish at a kind-dispatch boundary (WP03, FR-003/SC-002).

Two sites dispatch on :class:`~doctrine.drg.models.NodeKind` and drop what they
do not name:

===========================================  ==============  ============
Site                                         Shape           Kinds lost
===========================================  ==============  ============
``doctrine.drg.query.resolve_transitive_refs``  16 buckets filled, 10 read out   6
``charter.context._classify_artifact_urns``     4 branches, no ``else``          12
===========================================  ==============  ============

Both figures were re-derived by execution on this branch. **The two drops differ
in kind, and the distinction is load-bearing** — an earlier revision of this
docstring (and of the WP prompt) called both "live", which is wrong for the first
site:

* ``resolve_transitive_refs`` — **latent.** The shipped graph carries 35 nodes in
  unnameable kinds (``action`` 24, ``anti_pattern`` 6, ``mission_type`` 4,
  ``glossary_pack`` 1), but *carried is not reached*. All three production call
  sites pass ``{REQUIRES, SUGGESTS}`` with seeds limited to
  directive/tactic/paradigm plus ``_direct_root_urns``; the only edges into those
  kinds are ``mission_type --requires--> action`` (×21, and ``mission_type`` is
  never a seed) and ``paradigm --rejects--> anti_pattern`` (×8, and ``rejects`` is
  never passed). Zero unnamed kinds are reachable today.
* ``_classify_artifact_urns`` — **live.** Measured through the real path across
  all 24 shipped actions: **56** artifact-URN visits are discarded
  (``procedure`` 26, ``template`` 15, ``paradigm`` 12, ``agent_profile`` 3).

Latency is an argument *for* totality here, not against it: a raise would be a
timebomb the moment mission C authors anti-patterns, an org pack seeds a
``mission_type``, or any caller passes ``REJECTS``. Totality needs no edit then.

Why the two sites get *different* closures
------------------------------------------
They are not the same defect wearing two hats:

* ``resolve_transitive_refs`` is a **lossless bucketing wrapper**. Its job is to
  return what the walk found. Raising would be wrong even though nothing reaches
  those kinds today — it converts a latent gap into a future outage. So the
  closure is *totality*: a per-kind view seeded from
  ``NodeKind`` itself, so nothing can fall out and a kind added tomorrow is
  carried without anyone editing the wrapper. This also keeps the frozen
  contract at
  ``kitty-specs/excise-doctrine-curation-and-inline-references-01KP54J6/contracts/resolve-transitive-refs.contract.md``
  intact — that contract says the function does **not** raise (:89, :204), and
  a total result never needs to.

* ``_classify_artifact_urns`` is a **deliberate 4-way projection** into an
  action bundle that has exactly four slots. Twelve kinds legitimately have no
  slot. The defect is not that they are excluded, it is that *exclusion and
  ignorance are indistinguishable*. The closure is an explicit, total
  kind→slot declaration: excluded kinds say so, and a kind nobody has ruled on
  is loud.

Pinned behaviourally, not by code shape (#2532)
-----------------------------------------------
`#2532 <https://github.com/Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty/issues/2532>`_ decomposes
``src/charter/context.py``, so the missing ``else`` lives inside a module about
to be split apart. Every assertion below is therefore written against
*observable outcomes* — "this kind survives the round trip", "an unruled kind
raises" — and never against the presence of a branch, a line number, or a
literal count of arms. A decomposition may move any of this code anywhere; it
cannot make these tests pass while reopening the drop.
