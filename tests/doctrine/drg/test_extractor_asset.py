"""Tests for ASSET registration in the migration extractor + doctrine CLI (WP05).

Covers:
- T019: ``_discover_built_in_artifact_nodes`` scans ``assets/built-in`` and
  registers discovered ``*.asset.yaml`` files as ``NodeKind.ASSET`` nodes.
- T019: ``_kind_for_type`` stays ``.get``-based (never a raising subscript), so
  an unknown/new reference type is skipped cleanly instead of raising
  ``KeyError``. (WP04 of ``doctrine-silence-guards-01KYFV7Q`` made ``_KIND_MAP``
  itself total over ``NodeKind``; the ``.get`` contract at this read site is
  unchanged and still guards typo'd reference types.)
- T020: ``doctrine.py::_SUFFIX_TO_KIND`` resolves ``*.asset.yaml`` to the
  ``("assets", "asset")`` kind pair.

    Re-pinned by WP04 (FR-004). The probe used to be ``asset``, on the reasoning
    that built-in reference fields never target assets by type. But ``asset`` is
    a ``NodeKind``, and using a real kind as the "unknown type" specimen is what
    let ``_KIND_MAP`` sit at 11 of 16 members with a test apparently vouching for
    it. ``_KIND_MAP`` is now derived from ``NodeKind`` and total; the probe moved
    to a string that is genuinely not a kind, which is what the contract was ever
    about.
