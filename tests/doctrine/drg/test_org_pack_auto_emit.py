"""Tests for FR-014 DRG auto-emit on org pack load (WP06 T036).

When a pack artifact declares ``enhances: <id>`` or ``overrides: <id>``,
:func:`doctrine.drg.org_pack_loader.load_org_pack` MUST auto-emit a matching
edge into the pack's DRG fragment. A hand-authored duplicate of the same edge
contributes once to the merged graph, deduplicated by
``(source, target, relation)`` — see
:class:`doctrine.drg.merge._OrgEdgeCollector` for why that reconciliation is
owned by the merge rather than by this loader.

#: with a governance author's own rationale, and
#: ``merge._warn_discarded_edge_rationale`` read that shared field as proof an
#: author had written something — so a pack in the sanctioned migration-window
#: shape (a legacy ``enhances:`` field plus the explicit fragment edge that
#: documents it) was warned at for discarding boilerplate the machine wrote.
#: Splitting the field is the fix, so asserting the split is the contract:
#: machine provenance on ``generated_reason``, ``reason`` empty unless a human
#: filled it.

    moved is *where* it is enforced.

    This used to assert on ``fragment.edges``, i.e. on a dedup the loader
    performed over the RAW endpoint strings. That could only ever collapse the
    byte-identical case exercised below: the projection path emits qualified
    ``<kind>:<id>`` endpoints while an author naturally writes bare ids, and
    the loader cannot resolve a bare id it does not declare (that needs the
    built-in layer). Keeping a partial reconciliation upstream is what made a
    duplicate-emitting merge look reconciled.

    So the assertion follows the guarantee to the merge. The loader now
    reports what the pack literally declares — during the migration window
    that doubled entry is the signal that a leftover ``enhances:`` field is
    still there — and the merge collapses by resolved triple. The bare-vs-
    qualified case the loader never could catch is covered in
