"""org->DRG bridge integrity (WP08, FR-010/FR-011, SC-009).

The bridge between an organisation pack's fragment shape (bare ids + plural
kinds) and the canonical DRG (URNs + :class:`NodeKind`) had five measured
integrity defects, each an instance of the mission's root finding — *the
doctrine layer's failure mode is silence, not error*. Measured on
``remediation/doctrine-silence-guards`` @ ``13464fea7`` before this file
existed:

===  ===================================================  =====================

ADR ``2026-07-26-3`` makes this file's fixes a precondition for mission B1:
adding ``Relation.IMPACTS`` to a bridge with a silent-drop path ships a
relation that works for built-ins and silently fails for external packs.

Every test here drives the **real** transport
(:func:`doctrine.drg.merge.merge_three_layers`) — no reimplementation of the
resolution rules under test.
