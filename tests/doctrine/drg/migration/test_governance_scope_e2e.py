"""Built-in end-to-end characterization pin for governance-profile fail-loud (#3629 p2).

WP03 / T013. The built-in guard
(:func:`doctrine.drg.migration.extractor.assert_governance_scope_edges_resolve`)
is already wired into :func:`~doctrine.drg.migration.extractor.generate_graph`
and its unit tests exercise it against *synthetic* edges. This module drives the
whole ``generate_graph`` pipeline against a real, fully-minted node universe so
the WIRING (not just the pure check) is pinned: a fictional ``selected_*`` id in
a built-in ``governance-profile.yaml`` must raise a ``ValueError`` naming
``mission_type:field=id``, and a valid selection must not raise.

This is a **characterization pin**, not a red-first bug fix (squad finding G8):
the guard already passes on arrival. It exists to protect the existing wiring
from silent regression, and it asserts the full ``mission_type:field=id`` token
shape that the extractor's own end-to-end test only partially checks.
