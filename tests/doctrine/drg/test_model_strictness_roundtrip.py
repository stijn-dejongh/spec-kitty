"""Strict DRG/profile models + field-derived writers (WP04, FR-004 / C-001 / SC-003).

Two silences, and they only close together
------------------------------------------
A field can go missing at either end of the same trip, and closing one end alone
ships a worse bug than leaving both open:

**Read end.** ``DRGNode``, ``DRGEdge`` and ``AgentProfile`` declared no
``extra`` policy, so Pydantic v2's ``extra="ignore"`` default applied: an
authored key the model does not declare was dropped on load with no warning.
Every sibling model under ``src/doctrine/**/models.py`` already declares
``extra="forbid"`` (``tactics``, ``directives``, ``procedures``, ``paradigms``,
``missions``, ``styleguides``, ``toolguides``, ``assets``, ``glossary_packs``,
``model_task_routing``, ``import_candidates``) —
``drg/models.py`` and ``AgentProfile`` were the outliers, not the innovation.
(The former ``ContextSources`` value object was retired in mission
doctrine-drg-silent-drop-boundary-01M0PE7E; ``AgentProfile`` itself now carries
the ``extra="forbid"`` boundary for the whole profile.)

**Write end.** The extractor's ``_node_to_dict`` / ``_edge_to_dict`` restated
their model's field names by hand. A field added to the model but not to the
writer loads fine, is reachable in memory, and is deleted the next time the
graph is written.

C-009 requires the model change and the writer change in one commit for exactly
that reason. Landing ``extra="forbid"`` alone would make an authored ``impacts``
key *load* — and still vanish on the next regeneration, now with a passing model
test to vouch for it. That is a strictly worse failure than today's, because it
buys a green assertion.

What the round-trip test actually proves
----------------------------------------
"A new field survives write→read" is only meaningful if the new field is *new*.
Asserting on ``when`` or ``reason`` proves nothing: a hand-written writer that
names them passes. So this module attacks it from both sides:

1. :func:`test_every_declared_edge_field_is_emitted_unless_explicitly_withheld`
   pins the *real* ``DRGEdge``: the emitted key set must equal
   ``model_fields`` minus a named withholding set. That is total over the model,
   so a field added tomorrow must either be emitted or be explicitly withheld —
   there is no third outcome where it is quietly absent.
2. :class:`_DRGEdgeWithNewField` adds a genuinely undeclared-today field and
   drives it through ``_edge_to_dict`` → YAML → re-validate. This is the
   behavioural half; it fails against a writer that restates field names, which
   :func:`test_the_hand_written_writer_shape_would_drop_the_new_field` proves by
   running the replaced writer shape against the same edge (T022 — the
   round-trip must not be green for free).

The withholding set is not an escape hatch
------------------------------------------
``provenance`` is deliberately not serialised: it is a merge-time marker
(FR-013) that is ``None`` for every extractor-built node, and emitting it would
churn the shipped graph. That exclusion is a *declaration*, not a silence — it
lives in one named frozenset, every member is asserted to be a real model field
(so it cannot rot into a typo that silently withholds nothing), and the
withholding itself is asserted rather than assumed.

Why ``_KIND_MAP`` is here and not in WP03
-----------------------------------------
``_KIND_MAP`` mapped 11 of ``NodeKind``'s 16 members, dropping ``anti_pattern``,
``asset``, ``glossary``, ``glossary_pack`` and ``glossary_scope``. It is
``str``-keyed, which is why the ``NodeKind``-keyed totality guard in
``test_kind_mapping_totality.py`` could not see it — a hand-restated table one
step outside the gate that exists to catch hand-restated tables. Closing it by
*deriving* the table from ``NodeKind`` removes the restatement rather than
lengthening it.

Measured graph-neutral on this branch: regenerating with the total map moves the
extractor graph by zero nodes and zero edges (305/757 before and after; the
shipped 311/774 adds the hand-authored ``anti_pattern`` fragment the extractor
does not produce). The gap is latent, not live — it goes live when mission C
authors anti-patterns and assets that other artefacts *reference*. The shipped
311/774 invariant is pinned once, by WP03's
``test_unknown_kind_fails_loudly.py``; it is deliberately not restated here.

Why extractor symbols are reached through the module
----------------------------------------------------
``from ... extractor import _KIND_MAP, ...`` would make this module fail to
*import* on the planning base, and a collection error is a poor ATDD red: it
says "one of these names is missing" and nothing about which behaviours are
broken. Reaching them as ``extractor.<name>`` keeps the module importable, so
the red-first commit produces a per-test failure map that names each defect
separately.

    reported rather than swept, and it is the *org-pack migration* path -- a
    dropped field there lands in a downstream consumer's tree, not ours.

    Unifying the two writers is deliberately NOT done here: ``rewrite_opposed_by``
    lives under ``src/specify_cli/`` and reaches doctrine only through the
    ``charter.*`` facade (ADR ``2026-03-27-1``), so consuming the extractor's
    private serializer would breach that boundary. Promoting a public serializer
    across it is the architectural call #2977 asks for.

    hand-restated list is currently complete -- and goes RED the moment mission B1
    adds ``impacts`` / ``is_symmetric`` or B2 adds ``aliases``, which is precisely
    when the decision has to be made. Without it that addition ships as a silent
