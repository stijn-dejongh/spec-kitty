"""Regression test: shipped graph.yaml + project overlay is always cycle-free
and otherwise structurally valid.

Replaces the coverage that previously lived in
``tests/doctrine/test_cycle_detection.py`` and
``tests/doctrine/test_shipped_doctrine_cycle_free.py``, which both imported
from the deleted charter transitive-reference module.

:func:`doctrine.drg.validator.assert_valid` rejects:

- dangling edges (target URN not in nodes)
- duplicate edges
- cycles in the ``requires`` subgraph
