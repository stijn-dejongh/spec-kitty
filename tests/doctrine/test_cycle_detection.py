"""Acceptance tests for cycle detection in doctrine artifact resolution.

These tests prove that cyclic cross-artifact references are caught and surfaced
as errors by the doctrine resolution entrypoint. A cycle in the reference graph
(e.g. Tactic A → Tactic B → Tactic A) would cause infinite resolution loops if
silently ignored, and is always a configuration error.

Test strategy
-------------
We construct minimal stub repositories whose artifacts deliberately form cycles,
then call ``resolve_references_transitively`` (the public resolution entrypoint)
and assert that it raises ``DoctrineResolutionCycleError``.

All tests are marked ``@pytest.mark.fast`` — no filesystem or subprocess I/O.
