"""Schema-generation integrity (WP05, FR-005, SC-004).

``scripts/generate_schemas.py --check`` verifies the committed schemas under
``src/doctrine/schemas/`` match what the Pydantic models (the single source of
truth, per the script's own module docstring) actually generate. Measured
before this work package: it exits 1 with 7 stale schemas.

Three divergence classes were found, and only one was safe to accept as-is:

* ``enhances``/``overrides`` removed from the generated schema — **accept**.
  ``paradigms|procedures|styleguides|tactics/models.py`` each retired these
  fields (FR-028 hard cutover) and raise via ``@model_validator`` if either is
  authored; the schemas advertising them as valid properties documented a
  shape the loader rejects.
* ``structural_lint_config`` removed — **generator bug, not accepted**. It is
  a real field (``styleguides/models.py:92``); the standard pipeline just
  cannot derive its rich shape from a bare ``dict[str, Any]``. Fixed in the
  generator (``_styleguide_fixups``), not by accepting the deletion, which
  would have invalidated the shipped ``common-docs.styleguide.yaml``.
* ``point_in_time_marker`` removed — **adjudicated, not accepted**. Declared
  in no Pydantic model (there is nothing to declare it on — the field above it
  is intentionally typed as an opaque ``dict[str, Any]``) but used,
  structurally, by ``common-docs.styleguide.yaml`` and enforced by the
  ``docs_structural_lint.py`` asset. The JSON-Schema layer is the deliberate,
  narrower second source of strictness for this one field; see the
  adjudication comment above ``_STRUCTURAL_LINT_CONFIG_DEF`` in
  ``scripts/generate_schemas.py``.

This module pins the reconciled end state: ``--check`` exits 0, both retired
fields are gone, the restored contract validates the real shipped artefact,
the ``paradigm_reference`` rename resolves, and ``mission_step_template_ref``
is emitted. It is RED against the stale schemas and GREEN once T024-T027 land.
