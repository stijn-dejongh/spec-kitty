"""DRG resolver tests for the retrospective-facilitator profile and retrospect action.

Covers FR-001 through FR-004:
- FR-001: profile:retrospective-facilitator exists and resolves through DRG.
- FR-002: action:retrospect exists and resolves through DRG.
- FR-003: resolved scope surfaces the required FR-003 minimum URN kinds.
- FR-004: (contract) the resolver is deterministic (same inputs -> same scope set).

The test file is self-contained: it loads the shipped graph.yaml directly and
exercises the resolve_context function from doctrine.drg.query. No external
fixtures beyond the shipped graph are required.
