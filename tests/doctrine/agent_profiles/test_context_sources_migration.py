"""Falsifiable coverage for the ``context-sources`` -> ``*-references``
consolidation (mission ``doctrine-drg-silent-drop-boundary-01M0PE7E``, WP02,
#3629 p1).

The 25 shipped profiles are **green-by-construction**: every id they authored on
``context-sources.{directives,tactics,toolguides,styleguides}`` was already
present on the matching ``*-references`` field, so for them the migration is
pure deletion. That means the migration's *data-moving* branch (set-merging an id
that is absent from ``*-references``) is exercised ONLY by the divergent
user-profile fixture here -- not by any shipped profile. This module pins:

1. the data-moving branch (divergent fixture) — ids absent from ``*-references``
   land there post-migration;
2. no shipped reference id is lost by the removal (frozen pre-migration
   snapshot);
3. the shipped profiles no longer author ``context-sources`` at all, and
   authoring it fails to load (the fail-loud boundary, FR-006);
4. **C-006**: the per-``agent_profile:*`` golden edge-set diff against the
   pre-consolidation graph is empty EXCEPT the deliberately-ledgered delta
   (ledger entry (21) in
   ``tests/doctrine/drg/migration/test_extractor_projection.py``).
