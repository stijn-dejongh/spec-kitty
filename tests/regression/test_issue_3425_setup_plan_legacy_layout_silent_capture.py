"""Regression contract for #3425 — a fresh, un-migrated host must journal its
setup-plan capture instead of silently swallowing it.

Open P0: https://github.com/Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty/issues/3425

Correct root cause (the swallowed error is the **journal guard**, not a queue
default-path helper):

* On a runtime root that has never run the WP10 cutover the machine layout mode
  is ``LayoutMode.LEGACY``. Under the ProjectSyncStore-owned queue selection
  (FR-009 / C-003) a live writer is then handed a non-``project_only`` permit and
  ``_require_project_destination()``
  (``src/specify_cli/event_journal/journal.py:117-119``) raises
  ``ProjectLayoutRequiredError("live payload writes require the project_only
  layout; legacy state is migration input only")``.
* ``src/specify_cli/sync/emitter.py:2115`` catches that and prints
  ``Warning: event journal capture failed: ...`` to stderr only — the command
  reports success while the event is never journaled (a silent-success shape).
* The retired no-arg ``default_queue_db_path()``
  (``src/specify_cli/sync/queue.py:195-196``) is a **red herring** for this
  reproduction: it now raises ``LegacyQueueMigrationRequiredError``
  *unconditionally* (it is not layout-gated), so it is not what makes the
  reproduced setup-plan path fail closed. Attribution belongs to
  ``journal.py:119``.

Post-fix (WP03 / IC-02) a fresh root auto-publishes ``project_only`` *before* any
legacy persist, so the live capture lands in the project store journal and no
swallowed-capture warning is printed; WP01 restores credential parsing so the
FR-011 auth gate confirms authentication instead of spuriously refusing. These
three tests drive the real ``setup_plan`` entry point
(``specify_cli.cli.commands.agent.mission.setup_plan``) end to end:

1. ``test_authenticated_setup_plan_journals_without_silent_capture_failure`` —
   an authenticated, un-migrated host drives setup-plan without a swallowed
   capture-failure warning; a live journal capture on the resolved project store
   lands exactly once (auto-cutover to ``project_only``) and the legacy store is
   never touched.
2. ``test_setup_plan_refuses_on_daemon_owner_mismatch`` — with credential parsing
   restored (WP01) the FR-011 auth gate no longer short-circuits, so the boundary
   preflight's daemon-owner-mismatch "Refusing" banner is the gate that fires.
3. ``test_setup_plan_authenticated_coherent_succeeds`` — a fully coherent,
   authenticated host (resolvable project identity + migrated ``project_only``
   store) gets past the boundary preflight (exit code != 2) instead of being
   spuriously refused.
