"""Scope: #2786 — a FAILED coord ``done`` revert during rollback is swallowed (permanent guard; #2786 FIXED).

**Landing note (2026-08, `tests/regression/` campsite clean).** Relocated
from `tests/regression/` to `tests/merge/` — its functional home alongside
the other merge-executor / coordination-rollback tests — now that #2786 is
fixed and this is a green permanent guard, not a red-first reproduction (no
`regression` marker). The issue number is kept as history.

This module reproduces **#2786** and now guards its fix. It began as an
INTENTIONAL, issue-pinned red-first P0 reproduction (per ADR
``docs/adr/3.x/2026-07-17-1``, expected to fail on ``main`` while the P0 was
open). #2786 is now **FIXED** — the rollback marks-not-raises and a strand-gated
``git revert`` heal on ``--resume`` restores coherence — so the reproduction
drives the strand and asserts coherence AFTER the heal. The ``regression`` marker
(which flagged the intentional-red-on-``main`` phase) is removed now that the
defect is closed; the test stays a green regression guard via its ``git_repo`` marker.

Defect (#2786)
--------------
The #2711 Option-A rollback reverts the committed coordination ``done`` commit in
lockstep with the working-tree byte restore
(``specify_cli.merge.executor._revert_coord_done_commit``). That revert is
**best-effort**: when the coord-worktree ``git revert`` itself FAILS (a conflict,
a dirty index, a broken worktree), the helper merely runs ``git revert --abort``,
logs a ``warning``, and RETURNS — it neither raises nor writes any durable
reconcile marker (executor.py, the ``if revert.returncode != 0:`` branch).

Consequently the committed coordination ``done`` survives while the working tree
is rolled back to ``approved`` by ``_restore_final_bookkeeping_snapshots`` — the
#2711 split-brain silently RE-OPENS along the revert-failure path that the
Option-A fix did not close. Nothing durable records that the two surfaces
diverged, so a later resume/merge cannot detect the incoherence either.

Reproduction strategy
---------------------
Reuse the proven coord-topology full-merge harness fused in
``test_issue_2711_merge_rollback_resume_coherence`` (itself modeled on the #1772
coord-branch harness the WP02/WP04 work used) and drive the pre-existing entry
point ``_run_lane_based_merge``:

* the mission records the per-WP ``approved -> done`` transition on the
  coordination branch BEFORE the target advance (``done_marked_before_target``);
* the target advance is injected to FAIL (``integrate_mission_into_target``),
  triggering the #2711 rollback path;
* the coord-worktree ``git revert`` is forced to return non-zero — exercising the
  REAL ``if revert.returncode != 0:`` failure branch of ``_revert_coord_done_commit``
  (abort + warning + silent return), the exact swallowed-failure path under test.

The coherence assertion (``committed_lane == working_lane``) then FAILS for the
RIGHT reason: the committed coordination reduction is stranded at ``done`` while
the rolled-back working tree reduces to ``approved`` — the swallowed-revert
split-brain. A non-vacuity witness proves the revert branch was actually hit and
returned non-zero, so the red cannot pass as a setup artefact.

#2786 is FIXED — the rollback marks-not-raises (durable ``pending_coord_reconcile``
marker) and the resume heal reverts the stranded coord ``done`` via a strand-gated
``git revert``; this module verifies coherence is restored after the heal and guards
against regression.
