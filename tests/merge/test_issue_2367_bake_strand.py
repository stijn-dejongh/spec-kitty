"""Scope: #2367 Mechanism B — the merge coord write-set is not atomic (permanent guard; #2367-B FIXED).

**Landing note (2026-08, `tests/regression/` campsite clean).** Relocated
from `tests/regression/` to `tests/merge/` — its functional home alongside
the other merge-executor / coordination-rollback tests — now that Mechanism B
is fixed and this is a green permanent guard, not a red-first reproduction
(no `regression` marker). Issue **#2367 itself remains OPEN** as of this
relocation: Mechanism A of #2367 was split out and closed separately as
#2795, and Mechanism B (this module's scope) is fixed, but the parent issue
may still track a remainder. This module is the Mechanism-B green guard, not
that possible remainder's repro — do not treat it as proof #2367 is fully
closed.

This module reproduces **#2367 Mechanism B** and now guards its fix. It began as
an INTENTIONAL, issue-pinned red-first P0 reproduction (per ADR
``docs/adr/3.x/2026-07-17-1``, expected to fail on the mission base while the P0
was open). The unified #2786/#2367-B fix has now LANDED — mark-not-raise +
strand-gated resume heal — so the reproduction drives the bake strand and asserts
coherence AFTER the heal. The ``regression`` marker (which flagged the
intentional-red phase) is removed now that the defect is closed; the test stays a
green regression guard via its ``git_repo`` marker.

Defect (#2367 Mechanism B)
--------------------------
``spec-kitty merge`` records the per-WP ``approved -> done`` transition for each
merged WP through its OWN ``BookkeepingTransaction`` (N independent COMMITTED
coordination-branch transactions) inside
``specify_cli.merge.done_bookkeeping._record_merged_wps_done_for_merge``. That
loop is not one atomic unit. When it FAILS mid write-set — after ≥1 per-WP
``done`` has already COMMITTED to the coordination branch, before the remaining
WPs are marked — the executor's failure branch
(``specify_cli.merge.executor._phase_bake_and_pre_target_done``, the
``except Exception:`` at ≈406-408) restores **working-tree bytes only**:
it calls ``_restore_final_bookkeeping_snapshots`` and RE-RAISES. It does **NOT**
call ``_revert_coord_done_commit`` (that runs only on the *target-advance* /
*squash-conflict* rollback paths via ``_restore_pre_target_if_at_baseline``,
executor ≈535-536 — which are therefore revert-covered and would repro
VACUOUSLY GREEN).

Consequently the already-committed per-WP ``done`` commits survive on the
coordination ref while the working tree is byte-restored to ``approved`` — the
identical byte-restore-**without**-revert mechanism as #2786 (#2786 = the revert
itself *failed*; #2367-B = the revert was *never called* because the failure
preceded it). The coordination worktree is left tracked-dirty, and the committed
reduction (``done``) diverges from the working reduction (``approved``) — a
split-brain the #1826 safe-resync guard then correctly refuses to ``reset --hard``
over, blocking the next merge/resume.

Reproduction strategy
---------------------
A ``>=2``-WP coordination-topology fixture (authored locally — the #2711
``_bootstrap_coord_mission`` is single-WP and has NO bake-loop injection hook; it
is in no WP's ``owned_files`` and is NEVER edited here; only the primitive
``_init_git_repo`` / ``_git`` helpers are reused):

* **WP01** commits its ``approved -> done`` to the coordination branch first, then
* the failure is injected **inside** ``_record_merged_wps_done_for_merge`` by a
  ``_mark_wp_merged_done`` ``side_effect`` that delegates to the real helper for
  WP01 (so its ``done`` genuinely lands) and RAISES on **WP02** — exercising the
  real ``executor.py:406-408`` byte-restore-without-revert branch;
* **WP02** is only ever ``approved`` (never marked) — the *coherent* control that
  falsifies both a hardcoded ``["WP01"]`` and an over-broad ``all_wp_ids`` strand
  set.

The stranded set is reduced from the COMMITTED coordination ref via
``_durable_done_wps_on_coordination_ref`` (git-reducible authority; NOT a live
worktree diff, which is empty at the mark point per data-model D7, and NOT any
marker/doctor surface — those do not exist on the base and would red with
``AttributeError`` = forbidden setup-red). The coherence CONTRACT then FAILS for
the RIGHT reason: after a ``spec-kitty merge --resume`` heal (a no-op on the base
until the WP03 repair lands), the committed reduction is stranded at ``done``
while the working tree reduces to ``approved``.

#2367 Mechanism B is FIXED — the bake-path rollback marks-not-raises (durable
``pending_coord_reconcile`` marker) and the resume heal reverts the stranded coord
``done`` via a strand-gated ``git revert``; this module verifies coherence is
restored after the heal and guards against regression. (Mechanism A — claim-time
VCS-lock resync — is deferred to #2795.)
