"""Consolidated compat-surface guard for the ``specify_cli.merge`` seam family.

Mission dev-assist-retire-path-hardening-01KXAVR0, WP04 (#2565 / #2071). The
#2057 decomposition left the ``cli.commands.merge`` re-export identity check
fragmented across ``tests/merge/*_seam.py`` -- 8 test functions across 7 of the
8 seam files, under 4 different names, over 4 different constants
(``forecast.py`` has none) -- plus 8 byte-identical one-way-import guards, one
per seam file. Both were real, unique coverage (not duplicated by
``tests/specify_cli/cli/commands/test_merge_cli_golden.py``, which only pins
public commands) but re-broke per-seam instead of failing loudly next to the
shim. This module is the single consolidated guard, shaped after
``tests/runtime/test_bridge_compat_surface.py`` / ``test_mission_shim_reexports.py``.

Per the codebase convention (``test_bridge_compat_surface.py:132-138``) this
guard is self-contained -- no cross-family shared helper module.
