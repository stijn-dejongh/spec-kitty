# Engineering notes — Reflections

This directory holds **quick, dated notes about process inaccuracies, idiosyncratic mismatches, and ad-hoc findings** that surface during day-to-day work on Spec Kitty itself or in projects that adopt Spec Kitty.

It is intentionally **not** a place for architectural decisions (those go to `architecture/3.x/adr/`), nor for charter doctrine (that goes to `.kittify/doctrine/`), nor for mission specs (those live under `kitty-specs/`).

## What belongs here

- Times a tool, skill, or runtime behaved in a way that did not match the operator's mental model.
- Cases where a default produced a sensibly-functional-but-suboptimal output that needed a second pass to correct.
- Workarounds discovered in passing that aren't yet codified into a skill or tactic.
- Observations about how Spec Kitty's own ceremony surfaces interact with the project's protected-branch / pre-commit / CI configuration.
- Friction or surprise notes from dogfooding the toolchain.

## What does NOT belong here

- **Architectural decisions.** Use ADRs.
- **Doctrine changes.** Use the charter / doctrine packs.
- **Mission specs.** Use `kitty-specs/`.
- **Bug fixes ready to commit.** Open a GitHub issue and fix in code.
- **User-facing documentation.** Use `docs/` (other subdirectories).
- **Long-form retrospectives.** Use `retrospective-facilitator` agent profile output, not this directory.

## File format

One file per reflection. Filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-short-kebab-slug.md`. The first line is an H1 title; the second line is a single-sentence summary; everything below that is free-form notes (suggested structure: *what happened* → *what should have happened* → *why the gap* → *follow-up*).

Notes here are **not load-bearing**. Curators may distill recurring themes into ADRs, doctrine, or skills — at which point the corresponding reflection can be archived or deleted with a note saying which artifact absorbed it.
