# 3.2.x Milestone — Roadmap

*Planner synthesis (planner-priti), 2026-07-04. Sources: milestone #4 census, the native epic dependency graph encoded in the tracker on 2026-07-04, [`degod-unshim-roadmap.md`](refactor/degod-unshim-roadmap.md), and the epic bodies of #1619 / #1797 / #2071 / #1868 / #2173 / #1746. Addendum, 2026-07-10: #2519 hot-list entry from epic #2519, member issues #2520/#2521/#2522/#2526, and current tracker metadata. Addendum, 2026-07-13: CI test-topology-performance mission shipped (PR #2609, under #1931); #1797 ↔ #2071 tidy-first intra-pair sequencing ruling recorded in Watch items + [`qa-tidy-first-sequencing.md`](testing/qa-tidy-first-sequencing.md). **Addendum, 2026-07-30: verified status re-read + spine re-anchoring — the body below (2026-07-04 vintage) predates the work that delivered the milestone's goals and mis-reads it as idle; see [Addendum 2026-07-30](#addendum-2026-07-30--verified-status-re-read--spine-re-anchoring) immediately below, and the PO-facing [3.2.x Open-Core Delivery Plan](3-2-x-open-core-delivery-plan.md) which supersedes the "G2-is-the-blocking-spine / G1-is-off-spine" framing.*

## Intent of 3.2.x

3.2.x is the **stabilization + structural debt paydown** cycle: (G1) deepen Doctrine/Charter/DRG impact on runtime execution, (G2) strangle the core domains — naming, identity, read/write paths — onto canonical SSOTs by *adopting* the existing execution-context machinery rather than building new construction, and (G3) land the DevEx enablers that make (G1)/(G2) enforceable. No new shadow paths. The milestone stays open until all three goals hold (full declaration: [`docs/release-goals/3.2.x.md`](../release-goals/3.2.x.md)). Everything experience-shaped — UX, dashboard, SaaS tie-in — is deliberately deferred to 3.3.x, which builds on the SSOTs this cycle establishes.

## Addendum 2026-07-30 — verified status re-read + spine re-anchoring

*Two read-only audits (G1 doctrine/charter; G2/G3 + release posture) grounded in the
code and the live tracker on 2026-07-30 found the body below has drifted from reality.
The corrections, in brief — full PO-facing detail in the
[3.2.x Open-Core Delivery Plan](3-2-x-open-core-delivery-plan.md):*

1. **The G2 "spine" is substantially DELIVERED, not idle — filed under new numbers.**
   The placement-seam swarm is the delivery of the named spine, and burn-down keys on
   the wrong anchors:
   - #2906 (read) / #2841 (write) / #2917 (birth-cutover) **deliver #1619** exec-context
     unification (old `core/execution_context.py` deleted, not shimmed; SSOT in
     `src/mission_runtime/`).
   - #2884 / #2262 / the MissionResolver port **deliver #2173** infra-port binding.
   - the coord-authority trio degod (`workflow.py` / `review.py` → 0 LOC) +
     `runtime_bridge` decomposition **deliver #1797** (shim registry drained to
     `shims: []`). Only `_read_path_resolver` (~1677 LOC) is parked.
   **Action R (re-anchor):** adopt the swarm as executing children of #1619/#2173/#1797
   and re-score the milestone against real coverage. The spine is not idle; its anchors
   went stale — the inverse of this doc's own "anchor to issue numbers" watch item.

2. **G1 mission-types-as-doctrine is BUILT and ACTIVE, not an unbuilt keystone.** The
   three types (+`plan`) resolve through charter → mission-type-profile → runtime; the
   data plane is 100% doctrine-sourced (profiles, step contracts, action indices,
   templates, prompts). Only the execution engine is code. **G1's done-signal is
   demonstrated doctrine→runtime governance (already true), not pack-split completion.**
   The real open G1 work is a bounded ~22-door list to make the **charter the sole
   access path** to provisioned assets (it gates only ~3 of ~10 kinds today).

3. **The cycle's organizing frame is an open-core breaking-change window**, not a
   feature-completeness sprint: draw + version the consumer seam, extract built-in
   doctrine into the already-declared `spec-kitty-doctrine` module (~90% done
   structurally; one import-cycle blocker), and ship the still-design-only schema
   (Creed / Values / the ADR-accepted `impacts` relation) behind migration rails +
   deprecation shims to a small consenting consumer set. No hard freeze. See the
   delivery plan and [3.2.x Delivery Approach](3-2-x-approach.md) (doctrine-first,
   confirmed).

4. **Release posture: `main` is NOT tag-ready** — CI red 10+ consecutive runs
   (2026-07-28→07-30), 9 failing jobs incl. `regression tests (blocking)`. Partly the
   red-main-is-honest baseline P0 pins (#2736/#2772/#1834); **unverified** whether a
   fresh write-side-seam regression is mixed in. Resolve that classification before any
   tag conversation.

*The dependency-spine section below is retained as the historical 2026-07-04 encoding;
read it through the corrections above.*

## The dependency spine

The epic graph is now encoded **natively in the tracker** as blocked-by edges (2026-07-04):

```
        #1868 seam-binding   #2173 runtime ports      (peer enablers)
                 \               /
                  ▼             ▼
              #1797 degod / unshim DELIVERY        #2071 test-QA friction
                  │       \                          /        │
                  ▼        ▼                        ▼         │
   #1619 runtime/state ROOT (P0)          #1746 Mission Clarity Layer (P1)
                                          — first FUNCTIONAL pickup

   #1931 test hygiene — standing campsite epic, deliberately OUTSIDE the blocking graph
   #2392 upgrade-worktree coherence — #1619 child epic, consolidation-only (see Watch items)
   #2400 metadata & profile authority (P1) — #1799 sub-epic, consolidation-only (see Watch items)
```

**Reading order — enablers → delivery → functional pickup:**

1. **Enablers first.** #1868 binds *what a seam is and refuses bypass* (layer rules, identity value-object, guard capability, CI suite map, contract versions); #2173 binds *how infra is supplied without coupling* (ports + default-param DI). They share mechanism and run as peers.
2. **Delivery next.** #1797 (degod/unshim) is *blocked by* #1868 and #2173: every shim deletion is only safe once the seam it held is bound, and every god-object extraction only pays off once its pure core is stub-testable through a port.
3. **Root closes on delivery + QA.** #1619 (unify mission execution context — the program root) is *blocked by* #1797 and #2071: the `MissionExecutionContext`/`ResolvedMission` adoption cannot complete while god-objects re-derive context per call site and while the suite's accidental-pass/duplicate-knowledge debt makes structural change hazardous.
4. **First functional pickup.** #1746 (Mission Clarity Layer, P1) is *blocked by* #1797 and #2071 — queued as the first functional mission once the debt cluster lands, co-designed with #1666's communication-artefact contract.
5. **#1931** (test quality & suite hygiene) runs as a standing campsite epic: folded opportunistically into missions, never a blocker.
6. **#2392** (upgrade-worktree coherence, child of #1619) is the same kind of standing consolidation epic as #1931, not a blocking node — it exists to fold a git-state bug cluster (#2385, #1873, #2105, and the partly-fenced #2367) into **one** canonical fix seam instead of letting each land as an independent partial patch. Alphonso's design: a canonical invariant (*every write in every checkout the upgrade run touches ends in exactly one auto-commit — derived from real `git status --porcelain`, not a hardcoded list — or is intentionally reverted*), landed via a single `commit_touched_checkout` helper extracted from `_auto_commit_upgrade_changes` (`upgrade.py`) and applied symmetrically across main + every `.worktrees/*` enumerated by `runner.py`. #2367 is flagged as one-invariant-three-seams and kept OUT of this helper (see Watch items).
7. **#2400** (metadata & profile authority, **P1**, sub-epic of #1799) is a second standing consolidation epic of the same shape as #1931/#2392, not a blocking node — it exists to fold the "instructed, not enforced" defect class (the same class as #2364's dispatch-time model-discipline rule) into one canonical resolver/event-log authority instead of leaving it as prompt instructions or drifting hardcoded frontmatter. Members: **#2399** (structurally enforce agent-profile loading across all four invocation contexts — ops/ad-hoc/dispatch/mission-WP) and **#2093** (WP-metadata authority split: static design-intent stays frontmatter-canonical; dynamic runtime state — `agent`/`shell_pid`/`history`/reviews — retires to event-log/invocation authority, generalizing the `lane` retirement; architect-alphonso's DECISION already rules this REWORK-staged). Related but not reparented: #1841 (WP-claim Python profile-load) and #1840 (skills subagent-delegation preamble). Mutual coupling: splitting `agent_profile` (intent vs. resolved-binding, #2093) is the **precondition** for #2399's enforcement seam; #2399's resolve→materialize→record mechanism is the **mechanism** that makes #2093's dynamic half real — sequence the pair together (see Watch items).

   *Addendum, 2026-07-16 (WP/Op schema arc):* #2400 is **no longer consolidation-only** — it now also carries a **functional build mission**. **#2684** (evict runtime-mutable WP state — `shell_pid`/`history`/subtask-checkbox/review-cycle/activity-log/`agent`/`assignee` — off `tasks/WP##.md` into the event log; native sub-issue of #2093, its **execution vehicle**) is real construction with its own AC set and a migration contract, not re-homing of existing behavior; it delivers the content-hash-churn fix as its **AC-5** and generalizes the shipped `lane` retirement. Alongside it: the **independent, ships-now** slice **#2685** (required-on-close structured Op debrief — optional `OpDebrief` on `OpCompletedEvent` for read-back safety + required-presence/graduated-depth enforced at `executor.complete_invocation`; sibling of #2399), and its follow-up **#2686** (semantic-only WP content-hash, largely subsumed by #2684's AC-5, `blocked_by` #2684). #2684 is **co-sequenced with #2160** on the shared `shell_pid` writers (see Watch items). The full **YAML-authoritative / markdown-derived WP-prompt flip is 3.3.x** — gated on **#1619** (the mid-revision WP/Mission aggregate), **#1676** (deterministic structured authoring), and **re-ratification of #2093's static-stays-in-file ruling by the #2400 owner**; #2684 deliberately stops at "file holds only static intent," not "file is derived."

## The G1 doctrine & charter arc (off-spine)

The dependency spine above is the **G2/G3** program — strangling the core domains onto SSOTs and the DevEx enablers that make it enforceable. But 3.2.x's *first* stated goal is **G1: deepen Doctrine/Charter/DRG impact on runtime execution**, and that goal has its own epic arc which sits **outside the blocking spine by design** — it is depth, not a blocker of the mission-execution root #1619. This section makes the arc visible so the roadmap reflects the whole milestone, not just the strangler.

*Added 2026-07-14 after an epic-graph audit found this arc unmodeled here and several of its epics unprioritized. Priority/milestone fixes applied in the same pass: #2466→P1, #1799→P1; the two P1 Glossary-as-doctrine epics #1629/#1418 pulled into 3.2.x. The doctrine arc's internal edges were audited and found already modeled at the right granularity (keystone-child, not coarse parent) — no new blocked-by edges were warranted.*

**The arc has four roots and one internal keystone:**

```
#2466 pack ecosystem (P1) ──[keystone #2467: split built-in → packs]──┐
   ├─ #2468 mission-types + step-contracts as doctrine kinds           │ #2467 blocks:

   └─ Glossary Doctrine Overhaul program (2026-07-21): #1418 → #2599 → #2822/#2830/#2823 → #2727
```

**Reading order within the arc:**

1. **#2467 is the keystone.** Splitting built-in doctrine into packs (built-in → org → project, `depends_on` DAG) is the substrate everything downstream builds against; it already blocks #2468/#2470/#2471/#2216.
2. **Extensibility kinds next.** #2468 (mission-types + step-contracts as doctrine kinds) and the closed #2469 (ASSET kind) are the prerequisites the **gates** sub-epic #2535 makes executable at a transition boundary.
3. **Governance semantics.** #2216 (component-type immutability + AUTHORITATIVE charters) rides on the pack tiers from #2467 — the edge exists at keystone-child granularity (#2216 blocked_by #2467), not a coarse parent edge.
4. **Authoring robustness.** #2519 runs its own #2526→#2522→#2521→#2520 sequence (foundation shipped); it is a sibling root, not gated by #2466.
5. **Trust / distribution (#2539) is 3.3.x** — the verified-pack story builds on this cycle's pack model but ships next milestone.
6. **Glossary-as-doctrine is now a sequenced four-mission program** (operator-decided 2026-07-21; ADR [2026-07-21-1](../adr/3.x/2026-07-21-1-glossary-first-order-doctrine-artefact.md), plan [glossary-doctrine-overhaul-program.md](glossary-doctrine-overhaul-program.md)). Keystone **#1418** builds the first-order `GLOSSARY_PACK` kind; then **#2599** lands the executable ASSET gate (phased trust model — built-in provenance only for now); then enforcement + terminology cleanup (**#2822/#2830/#2823**) ships adherence *as* a built-in ASSET gate; then the dead runtime `src/glossary/` is retired (**#2727**). Research resolved the #1418↔#2727 seed-into-runtime contradiction (do not seed into the dying package; migrate the 104 terms + repoint the casing gate, then delete).

**Exit-criteria implication:** the milestone's G1 goal is not satisfied merely because the spine closes. At minimum the arc's **keystone #2467** and the extensibility kinds it unblocks (#2468 and #2535's declarative-gate half) must land for G1 to have "deepened Doctrine/Charter/DRG impact on runtime execution" as declared. The governance-tier tail (#2216) and trust/distribution (#2539) may legitimately carry into 3.3.x — but as an **explicit re-milestone decision, not silent drift** (the same standing counter-measure as the milestone-drift watch item below).

## Wave status board (degod/unshim roadmap)

| Wave | Deliverable | Status | Anchors |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0** (S) | Bind CI suite map — marker→job authority; `-m unit`/`-m contract` select a job; fails closed | **SHIPPED** — PR #2368 (merged 2026-07-04, commit `6db60d367`; mission `ci-suite-map-bind-01KWNPMP`), marker→job authority bound — the substrate the ci-topology-shrink mission (below) builds on | #2297, #2296, #2034, #2333 CLOSED; **#2283 now CLOSED** (Phase 3 landed via PR #2442, 2026-07-07 — local pre-PR CI parity + factor-(a) verify; the factor-(c) *dynamic* half of the review-time boundary is realized by #2438's `pre_review_gate`, and the still-unmodeled contract-ownership half is filed as #2441 — see Watch items) |
| **1** (D) | tasks.py degod — body-thinning via ports, golden-CLI test first | **SHIPPED** — PR #2308 (tasks.py 4569→1206 LOC, 10/10 WPs) | #2116 CLOSED (+#2305/#2306/#2307) |
| **1∥** (U) | category_4 removable-now shim sweep (8→0) + orphan cleanup | **SHIPPED** — PR #2325 (unshim wave 1) | #2289, #2292, #2258 CLOSED |
| **2** (D+S) | coord-authority trio degod (workflow.py / implement.py / acceptance) + canonicalizer gate | **PARTIALLY QUEUED** — the #2164 Phase-1 canonicalizer gate is CLOSED; the trio degod itself is the next degod slice | #2164 CLOSED; #2160 OPEN (P0) |
| **2∥** (U+S) | `specify_cli.next` + `glossary` + charter shim deletions; WS1 layer rule bound | **SHIPPED** — PR #2328 (unshim wave 2, 9/9 WPs); shim registry drained to `shims: []` | #2291, #2290, #2326, #2327 CLOSED |
| **3** (D+S) | orchestrator_api degod + WS4 daemon-identity bind | **QUEUED** (category_7 orphan triage already executed in PR #2325; PR #2338 advanced the orchestrator-api contract to 1.2.0) | WS4 OPEN |
| **4** (D+S+U) | sync adapter cluster + WS6 contract-policy ADR + `category_b` burn-down (baseline 215) | **QUEUED** — safe last; adapter-shaped | WS6 in-progress |

Seam state carried from the wave plan: WS1/WS2/WS3 **DONE**, WS5 (CI suite map) **DONE — shipped with Wave 0 (PR #2368)**, WS4 open and WS6 in-progress (pinning bound; policy ADR missing) — they gate Waves 3 and 4 respectively.

## Milestone census (2026-07-04)

**271 issues milestoned: 141 open / 130 closed** (48% burn — the count *grew* by 40 on 2026-07-04 when the sub-issue milestone-consistency sweep pulled the spine's unmilestoned children, the critical-path P1s, and #1716 (folding the retired 3.2.1 milestone) into 3.2.x; the burn percentage dropped for honest reasons: previously-invisible scope now counts). Recent landings: PRs #2332 (dashboard identity fix), #2336 (move-task `for_review` recovery), #2338 (orchestrator-api resolve-workspace + contract 1.2.0 + changelog-symlink cutover + `predict_lane_worktree` SSOT seam); the 2026-07-04 backlog revitalization closed 24 stale issues.

**Since census (2026-07-05): mission `ci-topology-shrink-01KWQAVX` SHIPPED (all 6 WPs done)** — a concrete instance of #1931's standing campsite epic folding into a mission (see dependency spine, above), and built directly on the Wave 0 marker→job substrate (PR #2368, above). It delivers **all three #1931 pillars in one pass**: **shrink** (**#1933** — the 32 previously-unmapped `src/specify_cli` dirs folded into six named composite `dorny/paths-filter` groups: `auth_audit_git`, `lifecycle`, `agent_surface`, `closeout`, `governance`, `platform`), **split** (**#2378** — `fast-tests-core-misc` divided into two disjoint matrix shards), and **un-blind** (**#2383** — the `arch-adversarial` guard de-serialized off the `fast-tests-core-misc` critical path: `if: always()` (100% of `src/`, no filter-group gating) plus a dropped `needs` edge — path collapses `sum`→`max` toward the ≤13.6-min ceiling). Also fixed in-flight: the pre-existing `mission-loader-coverage` C-005 coverage-drop (silently absent from `sonarcloud.needs`). Gate-coverage ratchet refreshed: `total_tests` 28573→28709, `duplicate_test_count` 3550→707, `orphan_test_count` 0. Closes #2378, #1933, #2383 under #1931. **SHIPPED — merged as PR #2391 (2026-07-05); #2378/#1933/#2383 CLOSED.** A follow-up LOC-insensitive census-freshness gate landed via PR #2425 (#2416, 2026-07-06) so the topology census can't red on unrelated LOC churn.

  *Discoveries worth carrying into future #1931 slices:* (a) a freshness/coverage invariant that derives its expected set from the **live**, mission-mutated tree is self-emptying once the mission's own change lands — WP01 hit exactly this (the worklist-vs-mapped-dirs check became mutually unsatisfiable post-WP03) and the fix is to derive against a **frozen pre-mission baseline** instead; (b) the mandatory full `tests/architectural/` sweep at closeout caught 4 stale sibling contract tests (`test_ci_quality_path_filters.py`, `test_ci_architectural_gate_coverage.py`) still asserting the pre-mission CI topology — per-WP review suites never ran them and would have missed the regression; (c) `if: always()` alone only un-blinds a job, it does **not** de-serialize it — de-serialization needs the `needs` edge dropped separately, and this mission required both moves together to hit the wallclock ceiling; (d) a completeness guard must **derive its scan scope from the surface it protects** — the docs-only trim's first guard hardcoded 2 of the pole's 4 `matrix.paths` roots and ran green while blind to a docs-scanning test in an uncovered root, a false-green caught only by independent review; the fix parses the pole's live roots so the guard can't drift.

  *Backfilled in-PR (both prior residual items now RESOLVED):* the timings artifact carries the live measurement from PR #2391 ci-quality run `28731385584` — measured core-misc critical path **14.4 min** (arch-adversarial pole), a **51% cut** from 29.4; and the escape-hatch honesty-note wording is corrected. The measurement met NFR-001's binding 55% bound (14.4 ≤ 16.17) but the arch pole came in heavier than projected (14.4 vs ~12.3), so it sits just over the aspirational ~13.6-min next-lane sub-target.
  *Follow-up (P1, #2397 — under #1931): **RESOLVED.*** Matrix-sharding the `arch-adversarial` pole — post-de-serialization the single un-sharded critical-path bottleneck on every code PR — **landed via PR #2405 (2026-07-05, closes #2397)**, bundled with a charter-path CI hotfix. This applied the `fast-tests-core-misc` sharding pattern to the arch pole, the remaining lever to bring the path under the ~13.6-min next-lane sub-target. Same invariant surface (`always_on_arch_present`/`differential_arch_matrix`, `test_arch_pole_deserialized`, FR-006).
  *Also landed in #2391:* a **docs-only trim** on the always-on pole — a docs-only PR runs only the docs-relevant arch guards (`-m docs_scoped`, seconds) instead of the full ~14.4-min suite, while preserving doc-terminology/doc-scanning coverage (the terminology guard scans `docs/`).

**Landings since 2026-07-05 (verified merged to `main`):** a DevEx/CI-hygiene batch landed on 2026-07-07 on top of the ci-topology/arch-shard work above — **PR #2444** (SonarCloud QA config: `projectVersion` + coverage-scope alignment + read-only token; closes **#2421/#2422** under the Sonar-debt epic **#1928**), **PR #2438** (auto-scoped review-time regression gate at `move-task --to for_review`; closes **#572** — this is the factor-(c) *dynamic* half of the review-time boundary), **PR #2442** (local pre-PR CI parity + factor-(a) verify; closes **#2283** Phase 3), **PR #2429** + **PR #2433** (session-scoped test reaper + per-mission `/tmp` prompt namespace + workspace-context tombstone, and timing-isolation of the WP-prompt latency NFR; close **#1842/#2032** under **#1931**), **PR #2449** (review-prompt retention #2439 + coverage-allowlist repoint #2443; both CLOSED, epic #1931), and **PR #2452** (changelog backfill). The finalize-tasks glob-`owned_files` fix (**#2446**) is landing via **PR #2454** (still OPEN as of 2026-07-08). Two boundary tickets were newly filed in the process and remain OPEN: **#2441** (contract-ownership boundary — shared contracts + their retirement are not a modeled, owned artifact) and **#2447** (phantom `core/mission_detection.py::_detect_from_branch()` still referenced in shipped doctrine) — see Watch items.

**Hot list:**

- **P0 (4 open in milestone as of 2026-07-08; #2346 CLOSED 2026-07-04):** #2160 (coord artifact authority — the class the Wave 2 trio closes), #2071 (test-QA epic), #1676 (deterministic structured authoring — verified 2026-07-04: carries **zero native dependency edges**, so it sits entirely outside the spine; it needs an explicit scheduling decision, see exit criterion 7), #1619 (the program root). The former fifth, #2346 (move-task subtask-guard regex leak — launch-blocker), was closed as the post-mission op.
- **P1s from the 2026-07-04 sweep — pulled into 3.2.x (operator critical-path ruling, 2026-07-04):** #1239 (retrospect synthesize rejects its own create records), #1231 (stale-WP indicator: shell_pid liveness), #1734 (in_review→approved guard forces `--force` on standard review flows), #825 (restore push-time SonarCloud — CI hygiene).
- **Clusters (open-issue labels):** workflow 54 · reliability 50 · tech-debt 45 · bug 40 — consistent with a stabilization cycle: two-thirds of the open book is reliability/workflow/debt, not new surface.
- **#2392 (new, P1, child of #1619)** — "upgrade-worktree coherence" consolidation epic: one canonical fix for state/gitignore propagation across coord/lane/main, replacing what was trending toward N single-path partial fixes. Members: #2385 (`_auto_commit_upgrade_changes` main-only scope leaves sibling worktrees dirty, tripping the merge NFR-002 guard), #1873 (`_upgrade_worktrees` skips saving synthesized metadata when detected version == target), #2105 (main-checkout commit-set completeness — largely STALE per the design, since the git-status-derived commit-set is already implemented for main; residual is scope-only). #2367 is fenced as partly separate — one invariant at three seams, not one code fix: #2367-A (vcs-lock) was a deliberate stop-gap for a race (#2222/C-003; committing it would reverse that call) and #2367-B (rollback stale status) lives in the merge-snapshot path, not the upgrade helper.
- **#2400 (new, P1, sub-epic of #1799)** — "metadata & profile authority" consolidation epic: single canonical source, *structurally enforced*, across WP frontmatter, the event log, and invocation-time profile loading — same defect class as #2364 (model-discipline rule bound only as a dispatch-time prompt instruction). Members: #2399 (structurally enforce agent-profile loading across all four invocation contexts — ops/ad-hoc/dispatch/mission-WP) and #2093 (WP-metadata authority split — static design-intent stays frontmatter-canonical; dynamic runtime state, incl. `agent`/`shell_pid`/`history`/reviews, retires to event-log/invocation authority, generalizing the `lane` retirement; architect DECISION already rules it REWORK-staged). Related slices, not reparented: #1841 (WP-claim Python profile-load), #1840 (skills subagent-delegation). Mutual coupling: splitting `agent_profile` (#2093) is the precondition for #2399's enforcement; #2399's resolve→materialize→record seam is the mechanism for #2093's dynamic side — sequence together.
- **#2519 (new, P1, G1 charter/doctrine)** — "charter authoring & lifecycle robustness" epic: the consume-and-govern paths for charter/doctrine are solid; the **author, observe, and reproduce** paths are thin. Surfaced while authoring the `mission-wrap-up-sequence` procedure + `DIRECTIVE_046` directly against `src/doctrine/`. Sibling to #2466 (extensibility/packs) from the first-party/maintainer side; **outside the blocking spine** (a G1-depth epic, not a #1619/#1797 dependency). A pre-spec research squad (2026-07-10) found the three original children collide on one un-owned defect — the activation surfaces (`config.activated_*` ↔ `answers.selected_*` → `references.yaml`/`graph.yaml`) are disjoint ledgers with no reconciler — so a **foundation slice #2526** is carved out as the prerequisite. Members: #2526 (**Slice 0 · foundation, prerequisite** — reconcile `config.activated_*` ↔ `answers.selected_*`, make `activate`/`deactivate` write-through or `--resynthesize`, extend `consistency_check` to config↔answers↔references parity; unblocks + de-conflicts B and C; the divergence bit PR #2524), #2520 (charter **domain events** `CharterCreated`/`CharterUpdated`, open payload, through the existing CLI sync/SaaS event path — no charter lifecycle event exists today; spans repo-local emit wiring + external `spec_kitty_events` contract + SaaS consumer; SaaS-emit sibling of #2518), #2521 (charter-init **harness-freshness preflight** + deterministic intake inputs — notes a future `charter discovery/update` custom mission type as the long-term vehicle), #2522 (**doctrine-authoring surface** — a `charter author` scaffold + maintainer how-to for the edit-built-in → regenerate `graph.yaml` → freshness-gate loop, currently reverse-engineered). Shared seams: `charter.activation_engine.commit_plan`/`_save_config`, `src/doctrine/graph.yaml` generation, the charter-init/intake flow — sequence **#2526 → #2522 (C) → #2521 (B) → #2520 (A)** (A∥B safe-parallel; A∥C and B∥C must sequence on the shared activation/derivation surfaces). Member issues milestoned 3.2.x + P1 (2026-07-10); full declaration entry in [`docs/release-goals/3.2.x.md`](../release-goals/3.2.x.md) under G1.

## Exit criteria for 3.2.x

Derived from the epics' own done-conditions; the milestone closes when all hold:

1. **#1868** — all six seams bound to a type/owner: WS1–WS3 done; **WS5 done — landed with Wave 0** (marker→job authority, fails closed, PR #2368); WS4 daemon identity and WS6 versioned-contract ADR complete via Waves 3–4.
2. **#2173** — Phase-1 canonicalizer gate ✅ (#2164 closed); **Phase-2 `MissionResolver` port** owning the single `kitty-specs/` walk lands; Clock consolidation and `InstalledVersion` routing complete. No over-injection; frozen `MissionExecutionContext` never carries adapters.
3. **#1797** — shim registry stays `shims: []`; `category_b` honest baseline (215) burned down per Wave 4; the filed unshim children (category sweeps, orphan triage) all closed.
4. **#2071** — audit children (CT1 #2072, CT2 #2073, CT3 #2074, CT4 …) remediated; test-hygiene directive + ratchet in force so the suite is scaffold again (CT8/CT9 already shipped via gate-substrate PR #2317).
5. **#1619** — one canonical `ResolvedMission`/`MissionExecutionContext` minted per invocation and consumed by claim/implement/review/finalize/status/runtime/orchestrator; the dual `target_branch` readers, mid8 fabrications, and S8 silent glob deleted; ambiguity always structured, never silent.
6. **#1746** — Mission Clarity Layer delivered (SI-01…SI-10: mission-card.json, README generation, EMI header injection) as the cycle's functional capstone.
7. **P0 book empty** — #2346 fixed; #2160's class closed by the Wave 2 trio; #1676 resolved or explicitly re-milestoned with rationale.
8. **Non-spine open book dispositioned** — the remaining milestoned issues outside the spine (the reliability/workflow clusters) get an explicit close-or-re-milestone pass; nothing rides into 3.3.x silently.

## Risks / watch items

- **#2339 — two-authority migration-id conflict — RESOLVED (CLOSED 2026-07-06).** The upgrade dry-run JSON contract that rejected dotted `migration_ids` (first live offender: `3.2.0rc45_retire_standalone_skill_surface`) was fixed by widening the contract pattern; it no longer reds local runs. It was the two-authority failure class Decision 8 of the suite-map mission (PR #2368) exists to prevent; the fix confirms that class is being paid down rather than accreting.
- **#2342 — quarantined perf test pending verdict (still OPEN 2026-07-08).** The retrospective 200-mission 5s NFR breach on CI (`test_200_missions_under_5s`) remains unadjudicated (real regression vs CI flake); the quarantine lane must not become a permanent parking lot. (Distinct from the WP-prompt-latency NFR flake #2032, which was timing-isolated and CLOSED via PR #2429/#2433.)
- **#2345 / #1790 — dedup decision MADE; #1790 still OPEN.** The dedup was resolved by picking **#2345** as the canonical ticket (CLOSED 2026-07-05 — bind the `occurrence_map_complete` guard at plan/tasks-finalize so bulk-edit schema errors fail before implement). Its sibling **#1790** (validate `occurrence_map.yaml` at authoring + add a rich-occurrences schema example) remains OPEN and should be dispositioned as the authoring-side residual rather than re-litigated as a duplicate.
- **Milestone-drift on critical-path items** — resolved for the known set on 2026-07-04 (#1239/#1231/#1734/#825 and #2034 all pulled into 3.2.x by operator ruling), but the class remains live: a critical-path issue filed without a milestone silently escapes the burn count. The sub-issue milestone sweep (executed 2026-07-04, see next steps) is the standing counter-measure.
- **#2071 children are audit-fed.** The epic forbids pre-creating children; exit criterion 4 has open-ended scope until the audit's ticket set is complete. Watch for scope creep into #1931 territory (hygiene items belong in the campsite epic, not the blocker).
- **#1797 ↔ #2071 intra-pair sequencing (tidy-first enabler).** The spine lists #1797 (degod/unshim) and #2071 (test-QA) as peer blockers of #1619 but leaves their *relative* sequencing implicit. Ruling ([`qa-tidy-first-sequencing.md`](testing/qa-tidy-first-sequencing.md)): they are **not merely parallel** — a **targeted** subset of #1797 is a cheap enabler of #2071, while the bulk stays independent. Only *structure-induced* test friction (fragile-because-god-module, per the [CaaCS co-change ranking](test-change-coupling-caacs.md)) is cheapened by degod; *test-intrinsic* friction (CT3/4/5 #2074/#2075/#2076, CT7 #2564, quarantine #2295/#2309/#2342, legacy-contract #2553/#2323) is not. Do **not** gate #2071 behind the full degod program. Order: (1) a small dead-code/deshim sweep first (`#2463`, `#2293`, `#2499`, `#2561`, + the `#2559` dead-code-gate tooling) — it deletes code *and its tests*, near-zero risk; (2) fold CaaCS-implicated god-surface degod **into** the QA mission as campsite-first WPs (route full decompositions `#2059`/`#2057`/`#2056`/`#2532` to their own #1797 slices); (3) fix genuinely-clean-but-badly-written tests directly.
- **Wave-numbering homonyms — confirmed, not hypothetical.** Mission names and the roadmap's Wave 0–4 are distinct namespaces: PR #2308 is literally titled "Wave 2 tasks.py degod" yet delivered the roadmap's **Wave 1**, and "Unshim Wave 1/2" (PRs #2325/#2328) map to roadmap Waves 1∥/2∥ (plus the Wave-3 category_7 slice in #2325). Anchor all status claims to issue/PR numbers, never wave labels.
- **Avoid multi-path split-brain bugfix.** #2385/#1873/#2105 are the same underlying defect (upgrade-run auto-commit doesn't cover every touched checkout) surfacing at different call sites; fixing them independently risks exactly the kind of divergent-husk split-brain regression this milestone is paying down elsewhere. **#2392** is the counter-measure: one canonical `commit_touched_checkout` seam, applied symmetrically, instead of N partial patches. PR #2387 (an earlier single-path attempt) was redirected to `pr:needs-revision` for this reason — it should be re-pointed at the #2392 design rather than landed as-is. #2367's two seams (#2367-A vcs-lock stop-gap, #2367-B merge-snapshot rollback) are deliberately kept OUT of the consolidation and tracked separately.
- **Instructed-not-enforced / metadata split-brain.** #2399 and #2093 are the same "canonical authority exists in name, bound only by prompt instruction or hardcoded frontmatter copy" defect class as #2364 (dispatch-time model-discipline rule) and the sibling framing epic #1868 (different concrete domain — package layering, mission identity, guard capability, daemon identity, CI suite map, versioned contracts — not agent-profile/WP-metadata authority). **#2400** (P1) is the counter-measure, clustering #2399 + #2093 under one sub-epic instead of three unrelated parent epics (#2399 was under #1799 alone; #2093 under #1676; the WP-claim slice #1841 and doc-only companion #1840 under #1808). The pair is mutually coupled, not independently sequenceable: land #2093's intent/binding split and #2399's resolve→materialize→record mechanism together, or the half that lands first has nothing to bind against.
- **Runtime-state eviction ↔ #2160 `shell_pid` writer collision (new, 2026-07-16).** #2400's new build mission **#2684** (runtime-state eviction) moves the `shell_pid` claim off `WP##.md` into the event log, but that claim is written at **4 sites** that overlap #2160's Wave-2 `implement.py`/`workflow.py` degod — `implement.py:1730`, `workflow_executor.py:669` (implement) & `:1337` (review), and `tasks_move_task.py:1638` (**`move-task`**, the primary lane-transition writer, initially undersized out of the eviction's scope). The eviction's `shell_pid` move must **co-sequence with (or land behind) the Wave-2 trio degod**, not race it; a native `blocked_by` edge #2684 → #2160 records the ordering. Also load-bearing in #2684: the ADR must pin whether runtime state that mutates **off the transition axis** (resume `shell_pid` refresh, mid-work subtask marks, activity-log notes) gets a non-transition self-edge event class, or folds onto existing transitions with a documented staleness-fallback behavior change. Scope + the authoritative squad corrections live in `wp-op-schema-design/docs/plans/investigations/wp-runtime-state-eviction-scope.md`.
- **Contract-ownership + doctrine-phantom residue (newly filed 2026-07-07, both OPEN).** Two tickets surfaced while landing the DevEx/CI-hygiene batch above. **#2441** — *contract-ownership boundary*: shared contracts and their retirement are not a modeled, owned artifact, so a WP can break a contract pinned by a test outside its `owned_files`; #2438's `pre_review_gate` catches the *dynamic* symptom at review time but the *static* ownership half is still unmodeled — needs a scheduling/scope decision (likely under #1868's seam-binding). **#2447** — *doctrine phantom*: the removed `core/mission_detection.py::_detect_from_branch()` is still referenced in shipped doctrine (`git-operations-matrix.md`), the prose sibling of the #2443 coverage-allowlist repoint (which fixed only the CI-config reference). Small, self-contained doc fix; fold into the next #1931/doc-hygiene slice rather than tracking standalone.

## Immediate next steps

1. **Wave 0 — ✅ done**: PR #2368 shipped (`ci-suite-map-bind-01KWNPMP`), closing #2034, #2333 (folded in-mission), and #2283 factor (a) — factors (b)/(c) remain under CT7 (#2077).
2. **Post-mission op — ✅ done**: P0 #2346 fixed (CLOSED 2026-07-04).
3. **Then the Wave 2 degod trio** (workflow.py / implement.py / acceptance) against the now-bound suite map, closing the #2160 class — still the next degod slice (#2160 OPEN).
4. **Keep milestones consistent downward** — ✅ executed 2026-07-04: the spine epics' sub-issue trees were swept (33 children assigned 3.2.x, 48 already correct, zero unexplained drift); the surviving deviations are all evidenced (#1711/#1709/#1710 at 3.3.x by operator batch; the Beads epic #1168 deferred to 3.3.0). The retired 3.2.1 milestone was closed and its last resident (#1716) folded into 3.2.x. Re-run the sweep whenever the spine gains children.
