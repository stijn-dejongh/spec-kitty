# 3.2.x Executive Overview

*Point-in-time stakeholder synthesis, 2026-07-30. Covers everything since the 3.2.4
release (2026-07-05): the shipped 3.2.5 release and the in-flight 3.2.6 cycle. Reads
the milestone from a PO / C-suite / customer point of view; the durable goal
declaration is [release-goals/3.2.x](../release-goals/3.2.x.md), the operator execution
detail is the [milestone roadmap](3-2-x-milestone-roadmap.md), the delivery strategy is
the [open-core delivery plan](3-2-x-open-core-delivery-plan.md), and what actually
shipped is the [changelog](../changelog/index.md). Status was verified by two read-only
audits on 2026-07-30; the delivery plan carries the evidence and the unverified-item
flags.*

## Bottom line

3.2.x is our **stabilization-and-foundations cycle** — no flashy new surface, by design.
Since 3.2.4 we shipped one full release (3.2.5) and have a rich sixth (3.2.6) in flight.
**The hard structural work this cycle exists to do is largely done** — our core data now
has single sources of truth, our governance layer now genuinely drives the product, and
our doctrine is becoming independently shippable. Two honest caveats: **3.2.6 is not yet
releasable** (our release gate is red by policy — see [Risk](#release-readiness--risk-candid)),
and the *remaining* work is small and well-understood rather than open-ended.

## What 3.2.x is for (in business terms)

Three goals, each a customer outcome:

- **G1 — Governance drives the product.** Our "doctrine" (the configurable rules for how
  missions, docs, and workflows behave) now actually controls runtime behavior instead
  of being documentation. **This is the foundation of our open-core model:** customers
  can tailor governance without forking our source.
- **G2 — One source of truth for core data.** We have been consolidating the places that
  decide *where mission data lives and how identity/state are derived* down to single
  authorities — the root cause of a whole class of reliability bugs.
- **G3 — Faster, more honest engineering.** CI and quality gates that make G1/G2 safe to
  keep changing.

## Progress since 3.2.4 — what it means for customers

**Customization & open-core (the strategic thread).** Doctrine is now **shippable and
forkable**: organizations can ship their own governance, docs standards, and supporting
files to their repos *without patching our code*. Pack locations are now portable across
machines and CI (no more hardcoded paths breaking teammates). This is the groundwork for
selling and supporting a customizable product on a stable public core.

**Reliability (the bulk of the work).** The changes customers will *feel*:

- Quality gates **stopped emitting confident-but-wrong verdicts**, and approved review
  evidence now survives a merge instead of being silently discarded.
- Work-package state now has **one authoritative record**, closing a class of "the tool
  says X but reality is Y" bugs.
- **Upgrades no longer strand or dirty** parallel work areas; the dashboard now correctly
  shows in-flight work that used to silently disappear.
- Connections to our hosted service **fail safely** instead of silently pointing at the
  wrong server.

**Robustness & automation.** Agent-driven and scripted/CI runs **no longer hang** waiting
for input — increasingly important as customers automate on top of us.

**Velocity & honesty.** CI is meaningfully faster, and regressions are now caught **at
review time rather than at merge**, shrinking the feedback loop.

**One breaking change customers must action:** very old (pre-3.2.x) missions need a
**one-command migration** to keep working. This was a deliberate trade — retiring a
dual-support path that was itself a persistent bug source.

## Strategic position: the open-core pivot is closer than the roadmap showed

A verified re-audit this week found our internal roadmap had **understated our
progress**. The core-data-consolidation work (G2) is substantially *delivered* — it was
simply tracked under the wrong labels. The governance layer (G1) is *already live* in the
product (three mission types run entirely off configurable doctrine today). The remaining
work to reach a clean open-core boundary is **bounded**: the doctrine module is ~90% ready
to stand alone as an independent package, and the last real gap is making our governance
layer the single, stable entry point that external adopters build against.

## Release readiness & risk (candid)

- **3.2.6 is not tag-ready.** Our mainline CI has been red for 10+ consecutive runs. This
  is **partly by design** — our policy is that mainline honestly reflects known
  release-blocking bugs rather than hiding them, and CI (not opinion) is the release
  authority. It is a discipline, not a fire.
- **The one open question:** whether *all* of the red reduces to those known, tracked
  blockers, or whether a recent change introduced something new. Resolving that
  classification is the single gating item before any release conversation — an
  hours-not-weeks task.

## What's next & the strategic call for the PO

The plan (see the [open-core delivery plan](3-2-x-open-core-delivery-plan.md)) is an
**open-core breaking-change window**: get the remaining breaking/design changes out **as
fast as possible** to our small set of consenting early-adopter customers, **without ever
stalling bug fixes for them**, and make each change cheap to absorb (automated migrations
+ backward-compatible shims + advance notice). After this window, the external surface
stabilizes and stops disrupting customers.

**Decisions that need product ownership:**

1. How to sequence the remaining breaking changes into releases (the "3.2.6 / 3.2.7"
   numbers are urgency signals, not commitments).
2. Whether to hold the honest-red mainline through the window, or stabilize the baseline
   first.
3. Confirming the named early-adopter customers who receive pre-releases and migration
   notes.

**In one sentence for the board:** *the risky structural rework of 3.2.x is largely
behind us and has de-risked our open-core direction; what remains is a bounded,
well-understood push to lock a stable customer-facing contract — the main open question is
release timing, not whether the foundation holds.*
