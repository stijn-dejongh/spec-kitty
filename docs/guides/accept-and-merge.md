# How to Accept and Merge a Mission

Use this guide to validate mission readiness and merge to the mission's target branch.

## Prerequisites

- All WPs are `approved` or `done`, with review feedback resolved
- You are in a checkout where the mission can be resolved (repository root checkout or execution workspace)

## Accept the Mission

Run acceptance after the implement-review loop approves every WP and before
merge. This is a readiness nudge for humans and LLMs; merge still performs its
own gates and remains the mission-close operation.

In your agent:

```text
/spec-kitty.accept
```

Or in your terminal:

```bash
spec-kitty accept
```

### What Accept Checks

- All WPs are `approved` or `done`
- Required metadata and activity logs are present
- No unresolved `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers remain

To run a read-only checklist (in your terminal):

```bash
spec-kitty accept --mode checklist
```

### Negative Invariants That Assert the Merged Post-State

The accept gate **re-runs each acceptance negative-invariant `verification_command`
live** against the working tree at accept time — it does not trust a stored
`result` or a hand-set `overall_verdict`. Two consequences follow:

- **Hand-editing a verdict does not stick.** Setting `overall_verdict` (or a
  negative invariant's `result`) by hand in `acceptance-matrix.json` is
  overwritten the moment accept runs; the invariant's `verification_command` is
  the single source of truth, and it must actually pass in the checkout accept
  runs from.
- **Merged-post-state invariants must be verified after merge.** If an invariant
  asserts a state that only exists **once the mission is merged** — for example,
  "`shell: bash` is present in `ci-quality.yml`" when that line is added by the
  merge — it cannot pass while the mission still lives on its lane branch. For
  such missions, run `spec-kitty merge` (into **local** `main`) **before**
  `spec-kitty accept`, so the working tree accept inspects already carries the
  merged post-state:

  ```bash
  spec-kitty merge          # land into LOCAL main first
  spec-kitty accept         # now the post-state invariants can verify live
  ```

  This inverts the usual accept-then-merge order and is only needed for missions
  whose negative invariants assert the post-merge result. Missions whose
  invariants describe the lane's own diff verify fine in the normal order.

  If you prefer not to re-order, scope the invariant to a path that exists on the
  lane branch (see `NegativeInvariant.scope`) or express it as a `custom_command`
  that is meaningful pre-merge.

### Deferred Invariants and the Post-Consolidation Gate

A scoped `grep_absence` invariant whose subject does not exist yet — because it
is added only by consolidating the mission's lane branches — cannot be honestly
judged at `accept` time. Rather than report a false "still present" or a false
"pass", accept records that invariant's result as `deferred_to_consolidation`
and the mission's `overall_verdict` as `pass_pending_consolidation`: acceptance
is **not blocked**, but the mission cannot reach `done` while the deferral is
outstanding.

**What this means for you as the operator:**

- **The mission loop does not verify a deferred invariant.** `spec-kitty accept`
  is the acceptance matrix's only pre-consolidation reader, and it is the gate
  that *creates* the deferral — it cannot also be the thing that resolves it.
  When `spec-kitty accept` assigns `deferred_to_consolidation` it discloses this
  immediately, in the same run, as a `negative_invariants_deferred` entry under
  "Skipped checks" — look for it in the console output or the JSON summary.
- **What verifies it instead** is the **post-consolidation verification op** —
  dispatched after `spec-kitty merge` (lane consolidation) completes, against
  the consolidated mission tree. It re-judges every `deferred_to_consolidation`
  invariant on that tree and records a terminal result
  (`confirmed_absent` / `still_present` / `verification_error`) stamped with the
  `CONSOLIDATED` surface. A violation fails **that verification op**, not the
  already-completed consolidation — see
  [post-consolidation / `CONSOLIDATED`](../context/orchestration.md#topology-surface)
  in the terminology glossary for how this surface relates to `spec-kitty
  merge`'s three overloaded "merge" senses.
- **What your repository needs**: a CI check on the pull request that fails when
  any `kitty-specs/*/acceptance-matrix.json` still carries an unresolved
  `deferred_to_consolidation` invariant. This project's own gate is
  `scripts/ci/check_dangling_deferrals.py`, wired into `ci-quality.yml`'s
  `deferral-consistency-check` job. **A repository without an equivalent check
  never verifies the deferral** — the disclosure above exists precisely so that
  gap is visible rather than silently assumed away (ADR
  [2026-07-23-2](../adr/3.x/2026-07-23-2-post-consolidation-deferral-and-external-enforcement.md)).

## Merge to the target branch

In your agent:

```text
/spec-kitty.merge --push
```

Or in your terminal:

```bash
spec-kitty merge --push
```

By default, `spec-kitty merge` lands in the mission's recorded target branch. Use `spec-kitty merge --target <branch>` only when you intentionally need to override that destination.

For detailed merge options including dry-run, strategies, and cleanup flags, see [Merge a Mission](merge-feature.md).

### When Local `main` Is Not Publishable

Autonomous local runs can leave `main` ahead of or diverged from `origin/main`
with planning, status, review, and orchestration commits. If merge refuses with
`TARGET_BRANCH_NOT_SYNCHRONIZED`, do not reset, rebase, force-push, or push
local `main` only to satisfy the pre-flight.

Open a focused PR from the mission result instead:

```bash
git push -u origin kitty/mission-<mission-slug>
gh pr create --base main --head kitty/mission-<mission-slug> --fill
```

Or create a dedicated PR branch from the mission branch:

```bash
git switch -c kitty/pr/<mission-slug>-to-main kitty/mission-<mission-slug>
git push -u origin kitty/pr/<mission-slug>-to-main
gh pr create --base main --head kitty/pr/<mission-slug>-to-main --fill
```

Prefer squash-merge when the autonomous run accumulated many orchestration
commits. For the full end-to-end path, see
[Run an Autonomous Mission](run-an-autonomous-mission.md).

## After Merge

Complete the following three steps before declaring the mission done.

**1. Mission review** — run the post-merge mission review to confirm spec→code fidelity and FR
coverage:

```bash
# In your agent:
/spec-kitty-mission-review

# Or directly:
spec-kitty agent mission review --mission <handle>
```

**2. Author or verify the retrospective** — under default policy the record was already written
during merge. Verify with:

```bash
cat .kittify/missions/$(jq -r .mission_id kitty-specs/<slug>/meta.json)/retrospective.yaml
```

If the file is absent (for example, an older mission predating 3.2.0), author it now:

```bash
spec-kitty retrospect create --mission <handle>
```

Reserve the noun "capture" for the event-log fact `RetrospectiveCaptured`, not for the
operator verb.

**3. Surface findings** — aggregate across recent missions or inspect proposals for this one:

```bash
# Cross-mission view (read-only aggregation)
spec-kitty retrospect summary

# Preview proposals in this mission's retrospective.yaml (dry-run by default)
spec-kitty agent retrospect synthesize --mission <handle>

# Apply a proposal (requires explicit --apply)
spec-kitty agent retrospect synthesize --mission <handle> --apply <proposal-id>
```

For full details on each command, see
[How to Use Retrospective Learning](use-retrospective-learning.md).

## Merge Strategies

- **Default (merge commit)**: `spec-kitty merge`
- **Squash**: `spec-kitty merge --strategy squash`

Note: Rebase is not supported for multi-workspace missions. Use `merge` or `squash` instead.

## Cleanup

By default, merge removes resolved execution worktrees and deletes the mission branch. Use these flags to keep them (in your terminal):

```bash
spec-kitty merge --keep-worktree --keep-branch
```

## Abandon a Mission (Manual Cleanup)

If you decide to drop a mission without merging, remove its execution worktrees and branches manually.
These steps are safe and reversible until you delete the branch and commit the cleanup.

1. List worktrees to find all workspaces for the mission:
```bash
git worktree list
```

2. Remove each execution worktree for the mission:
```bash
git worktree remove .worktrees/<mission-slug>-lane-a
git worktree remove .worktrees/<mission-slug>-lane-b
```

If a worktree has uncommitted changes you want to discard, use `--force`:
```bash
git worktree remove --force .worktrees/<mission-slug>-lane-a
```

3. Delete the mission branches:
```bash
git branch -D <mission-slug>-lane-a
git branch -D <mission-slug>-lane-b
```

4. Remove the planning artifacts from the repository root checkout (spec/plan/tasks), then commit:
```bash
rm -rf kitty-specs/<mission-slug>
git add kitty-specs/
git commit -m "Remove abandoned mission <mission-slug>"
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Accept reports blockers**: Resolve the listed issues, then rerun `/spec-kitty.accept`.
- **Merge fails**: Ensure your current checkout is clean and the mission resolves correctly.
- **Merge reports `TARGET_BRANCH_NOT_SYNCHRONIZED`**: Use the focused-PR path when local `main` contains autonomous-run history that should not be published directly.
- **Merge is heading to the wrong branch**: Inspect the mission's recorded target branch before retrying, and use `spec-kitty merge --target <branch>` only if you intend to override it.
