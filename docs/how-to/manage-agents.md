# Managing AI Agents

Learn how to add, remove, and manage AI agents in your spec-kitty project after initialization.

## Overview

Spec-kitty supports 12 AI agents, including Claude Code, GitHub Codex, Google Gemini, Cursor, Qwen Code, OpenCode, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, Kilocode, Augment Code, Roo Cline, and Amazon Q. Each agent provides slash commands for feature specification, planning, task generation, implementation, and review workflows.

This guide applies after you've run `spec-kitty init` and want to change which agents are active in your project. For initial setup, see the [Getting Started](../getting-started.md) guide.

Agent configuration is managed through `.kittify/config.yaml` and the `spec-kitty agent config` command family. The config file acts as the single source of truth - agent directories on your filesystem are derived from this configuration. This ensures migrations respect your agent selections and prevents unwanted directory recreation.

This guide shows you how to add agents to enable multi-agent workflows, remove agents you don't use, list configured agents, check sync status, and synchronize your filesystem with the config file.

The five core commands covered in this guide are:
- `list` - View configured agents and available options
- `add` - Add one or more agents to your project
- `remove` - Remove agents you no longer need
- `status` - Audit configuration sync status across all agents
- `sync` - Synchronize filesystem with config.yaml

## Prerequisites

Before using agent config commands, ensure:

- You have initialized a spec-kitty project (`spec-kitty init`)
- You are in the project root directory (where `.kittify/` exists)
- You have write permissions to the project directory

## Quick Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `spec-kitty agent config list` | View configured agents and available options |
| `spec-kitty agent config add <agents>` | Add agents to your project |
| `spec-kitty agent config remove <agents>` | Remove agents from your project |
| `spec-kitty agent config status` | Audit agent configuration sync status |
| `spec-kitty agent config sync` | Synchronize filesystem with config.yaml |

## Understanding Agent Configuration

`.kittify/config.yaml` is the single source of truth for agent configuration. All agent management commands read from and write to this file, and the filesystem is automatically synchronized to match it.

This means agent directories on your filesystem (like `.claude/commands/` or `.codex/prompts/`) are derived from the config file. When you add an agent using `spec-kitty agent config add`, the command creates the directory and updates the config. When you remove an agent, the directory is deleted and the config is updated.

Do not manually edit agent directories or config.yaml directly - use the `spec-kitty agent config` commands instead. This ensures consistency and prevents sync issues.

The key benefit of this config-driven model is that spec-kitty migrations respect your choices. In version 0.11.x and earlier, users could manually delete agent directories, but migrations would recreate them on upgrade. Starting in version 0.12.0, migrations only process agents listed in your config file - if an agent isn't configured, its directory stays deleted.

Here's the structure of `.kittify/config.yaml` for agent configuration:

```yaml
agents:
  available:
    - claude
    - codex
    - opencode
```

The `available` field contains a list of active agent keys. Each key corresponds to a specific directory:
- `claude` → `.claude/commands/`
- `codex` → `.codex/prompts/`
- `opencode` → `.opencode/command/`

When you run `spec-kitty agent config add` or `remove`, this list is automatically updated. Each configured agent has a directory containing slash command templates (like `spec-kitty.specify.md`, `spec-kitty.plan.md`, etc.).

Agent directories are created and removed automatically by CLI commands. You should never need to manually create or delete these directories.

> **Why This Matters**: In spec-kitty 0.11.x and earlier, users could manually delete agent directories, but migrations would recreate them. Starting in 0.12.0, migrations respect `config.yaml` - if an agent is not listed in `available`, its directory stays deleted. See [Upgrading to 0.12.0](upgrade-to-0-11-0.md#upgrading-to-0120) for details.

For architectural details, see [ADR #6: Config-Driven Agent Management](../../architecture/1.x/adr/2026-01-23-6-config-driven-agent-management.md).

## Listing Agents

### View Configured Agents

To see which agents are currently configured in your project:

```bash
spec-kitty agent config list
```

The output shows two sections: configured agents and available agents you can add.

Configured agents display a status indicator:
- ✓ = Agent directory exists on filesystem
- ⚠ = Configured in config.yaml but directory is missing (rare, indicates sync issue)

Available agents show which agents you can add to your project.

Example output:

```
Configured agents:
  ✓ opencode (.opencode/command/)
  ✓ claude (.claude/commands/)

Available but not configured:
  - codex
  - gemini
  - cursor
  - qwen
  - windsurf
  - kilocode
  - roo
  - copilot
  - auggie
  - q
```

Use `list` to:
- See which agents are active in your project
- Check if configured agents have directories on filesystem
- Discover available agents you can add

**Troubleshooting**: If you see ⚠ next to a configured agent, the directory is missing from filesystem. Run `spec-kitty agent config sync --create-missing` to restore it.

## Adding Agents

### Add One or More Agents

To add agents to your project after initialization:

```bash
spec-kitty agent config add <agent1> <agent2> ...
```

Examples:

```bash
# Add a single agent
spec-kitty agent config add claude

# Add multiple agents at once
spec-kitty agent config add codex gemini cursor
```

When you add an agent, spec-kitty:
1. Creates the agent directory (e.g., `.claude/commands/`)
2. Copies slash command templates to the directory
3. Adds the agent key to `.kittify/config.yaml` under `agents.available`
4. Displays success message for each agent added

Example output:

```
✓ Added .claude/commands/
✓ Added .codex/prompts/
Updated .kittify/config.yaml
```

### Error Handling

**Invalid agent key**: If you provide an invalid agent key, you'll see an error with the list of valid agents:

```bash
spec-kitty agent config add cluade
```

Output:

```
Error: Invalid agent keys: cluade

Valid agent keys:
  claude, codex, gemini, cursor, qwen, opencode,
  windsurf, kilocode, roo, copilot, auggie, q
```

**Already configured**: If an agent is already configured, it's skipped with a message:

```
Already configured: claude
```

### Common Scenarios

**Starting with one agent, adding more later**:

```bash
# Initialized with opencode only
spec-kitty agent config add claude codex
# Now you have 3 agents for multi-agent workflows
```

**Enabling cross-review**:

```bash
# Add a reviewer agent different from your implementer
spec-kitty agent config add codex
# Configure in .kittify/config.yaml:
# agents:
#   selection:
#     preferred_implementer: claude
#     preferred_reviewer: codex
```

## Removing Agents

### Remove One or More Agents

To remove agents you no longer use:

```bash
spec-kitty agent config remove <agent1> <agent2> ...
```

Examples:

```bash
# Remove a single agent
spec-kitty agent config remove gemini

# Remove multiple agents at once
spec-kitty agent config remove cursor qwen windsurf
```

When you remove an agent, spec-kitty:
1. Deletes the agent directory (e.g., `.gemini/` and all contents)
2. Removes the agent key from `.kittify/config.yaml`
3. Displays success message for each agent removed

Example output:

```
✓ Removed .gemini/
✓ Removed .cursor/
Updated .kittify/config.yaml
```

### Keep in Configuration but Remove Directory

To remove an agent's directory but keep it in `config.yaml` (for temporary cleanup):

```bash
spec-kitty agent config remove gemini --keep-config
```

**What this does**:
- Deletes `.gemini/` directory
- Leaves `gemini` in `config.yaml` under `available`
- Useful for temporary cleanup without losing configuration

**Restore later**: Run `spec-kitty agent config sync --create-missing` to restore the directory.

### Error Handling

**Invalid agent key**: Same error as `add` command - shows list of valid agents.

**Already removed**: If agent is already removed, you'll see:

```
• .gemini/ already removed
```

This is informational, not an error - command continues processing other agents.

> **Warning**: Removing an agent deletes its entire directory and all slash command templates. This is safe if you're not using the agent, but ensure you don't have custom modifications in those template files before removing.

### Common Scenarios

**Simplifying multi-agent setup**:

```bash
# Started with many agents, narrowing to preferred ones
spec-kitty agent config remove windsurf kilocode roo
# Keep only the agents you actively use
```

**Preparing for upgrade** (0.11.x → 0.12.0):

```bash
# Before upgrading, remove unwanted agents properly
spec-kitty agent config remove gemini cursor qwen
# Migrations will now respect your choices
```

## Checking Agent Status

### Audit Configuration Sync

To see a comprehensive view of all agents and their sync status:

```bash
spec-kitty agent config status
```

The output displays a rich table with five columns:
- **Agent Key** (cyan) - The agent identifier used in commands
- **Directory** (dim) - The filesystem path
- **Configured** (✓/✗) - Whether the agent is in config.yaml
- **Exists** (✓/✗) - Whether the directory exists on filesystem
- **Status** (colored) - Combined sync status

**Status values**:
- **OK** (green): Agent is configured and directory exists - normal state
- **Missing** (yellow): Agent is configured but directory doesn't exist - needs sync
- **Orphaned** (red): Agent directory exists but not configured - should be cleaned up
- **Not used** (dim): Agent is neither configured nor present - available to add

Example output:

```
Agent Key  Directory                Configured  Exists  Status
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
claude     .claude/commands/        ✓           ✓       OK
codex      .codex/prompts/          ✗           ✓       Orphaned
gemini     .gemini/commands/        ✓           ✗       Missing
cursor     .cursor/commands/        ✗           ✗       Not used
qwen       .qwen/commands/          ✗           ✗       Not used
opencode   .opencode/command/       ✓           ✓       OK
windsurf   .windsurf/workflows/     ✗           ✗       Not used
kilocode   .kilocode/workflows/     ✗           ✗       Not used
roo        .roo/commands/           ✗           ✗       Not used
copilot    .github/prompts/         ✗           ✗       Not used
auggie     .augment/commands/       ✗           ✗       Not used
q          .amazonq/prompts/        ✗           ✗       Not used

⚠ Found 1 orphaned directory
Run 'spec-kitty agent config sync --remove-orphaned' to clean up
```

Use `status` to:
- Audit your agent configuration for inconsistencies
- Detect orphaned directories (present but not configured)
- Identify missing directories (configured but not present)
- See all 12 agents at a glance

### Taking Action Based on Status

**Orphaned directories** (red "Orphaned" status):

```bash
# Remove orphaned directories automatically
spec-kitty agent config sync --remove-orphaned
```

**Missing directories** (yellow "Missing" status):

```bash
# Restore missing configured agents
spec-kitty agent config sync --create-missing
```

**Not used** (dim "Not used" status):

```bash
# Add to your project if you want to use them
spec-kitty agent config add <agent>
```

## Synchronizing Filesystem

### Auto-Sync Agents with Configuration

The `sync` command automatically aligns your filesystem with `.kittify/config.yaml`:

```bash
spec-kitty agent config sync
```

**Default behavior** (no flags):
- Removes orphaned directories (present but not configured)
- Does NOT create missing directories
- Reports actions taken or "No changes needed"

### Create Missing Configured Agents

To restore directories for configured agents that are missing from filesystem:

```bash
spec-kitty agent config sync --create-missing
```

**What this does**:
- Creates directories for agents in `config.yaml` but missing from filesystem
- Copies slash command templates to each created directory
- Also removes orphaned directories (default behavior)

**Example output**:

```
✓ Created .claude/commands/
✓ Removed orphaned .gemini/
```

### Keep Orphaned Directories

To prevent deletion of orphaned directories:

```bash
spec-kitty agent config sync --keep-orphaned
```

**What this does**:
- Does NOT remove orphaned directories
- Still creates missing directories if `--create-missing` is used

**Use case**: You have agent directories not in config.yaml but want to keep them (rare).

### Explicitly Remove Orphaned Directories

The default behavior removes orphaned directories, but you can be explicit:

```bash
spec-kitty agent config sync --remove-orphaned
```

This is equivalent to running `sync` with no flags.

### Complete Sync (Both Directions)

To fully sync filesystem with config (create missing AND remove orphaned):

```bash
spec-kitty agent config sync --create-missing --remove-orphaned
```

This ensures filesystem exactly matches `config.yaml`.

### When Filesystem Matches Config

If your filesystem already matches `config.yaml`:

```
No changes needed - filesystem matches config
```

### Common Scenarios

**After manual directory deletion** (not recommended, but happens):

```bash
# You manually deleted .gemini/ but forgot to update config.yaml
spec-kitty agent config status
# Shows "Missing" status for gemini

# Option 1: Restore directory
spec-kitty agent config sync --create-missing

# Option 2: Remove from config properly
spec-kitty agent config remove gemini
```

**After git checkout** (switched branches with different agent configs):

```bash
# Branch A has claude, Branch B has codex
git checkout branch-b

# Sync filesystem to match branch-b's config
spec-kitty agent config sync --create-missing --remove-orphaned
```

**Cleanup after testing** (removed agents manually):

```bash
# Default sync removes orphaned directories
spec-kitty agent config sync
```

## Agent Directory Mappings

The following table shows the mapping between agent keys (used in commands) and their filesystem directories:

| Agent Key | Directory Path | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| `claude` | `.claude/commands/` | Standard mapping |
| `codex` | `.codex/prompts/` | Standard mapping |
| `gemini` | `.gemini/commands/` | Standard mapping |
| `cursor` | `.cursor/commands/` | Standard mapping |
| `qwen` | `.qwen/commands/` | Standard mapping |
| `opencode` | `.opencode/command/` | Singular "command" subdirectory |
| `windsurf` | `.windsurf/workflows/` | Workflows instead of commands |
| `kilocode` | `.kilocode/workflows/` | Workflows instead of commands |
| `roo` | `.roo/commands/` | Standard mapping |
| `copilot` | `.github/prompts/` | **Special**: GitHub Copilot uses `.github` directory |
| `auggie` | `.augment/commands/` | **Special**: Key `auggie` maps to `.augment` directory |
| `q` | `.amazonq/prompts/` | **Special**: Short key `q` maps to `.amazonq` directory |

**Special Cases**:

- **copilot**: GitHub Copilot uses the standard `.github/prompts/` directory (not `.copilot/`)
- **auggie**: Config key `auggie` maps to `.augment/commands/` directory (Augment Code agent)
- **q**: Minimal key `q` maps to `.amazonq/prompts/` directory (Amazon Q agent)

For all standard agents, the agent key matches the directory name (e.g., `claude` → `.claude/`).

**Subdirectory Patterns**:

- Most agents use `commands/` subdirectory (plural)
- `opencode` uses `command/` (singular)
- `codex`, `copilot`, `q` use `prompts/` subdirectory
- `windsurf` and `kilocode` use `workflows/` subdirectory

These variations are handled automatically by spec-kitty commands - you don't need to memorize them.

> **When to reference this table**: Use agent keys (left column) in commands like `spec-kitty agent config add claude codex`. The directory paths (middle column) show where templates are stored, but you shouldn't need to interact with these directories directly.

## Troubleshooting

This section covers common issues you may encounter when managing agents.

### Orphaned Agent Directories

**Problem**: You see directories like `.gemini/` on filesystem, but the agent is not configured in `.kittify/config.yaml`.

**Cause**: Agent was manually deleted from config.yaml, or directory was created manually.

**Solution**:

```bash
# Option 1: Remove orphaned directory
spec-kitty agent config sync --remove-orphaned

# Option 2: Add to configuration to keep it
spec-kitty agent config add gemini
```

**Detection**: Run `spec-kitty agent config status` - orphaned agents show red "Orphaned" status.

### Missing Configured Agent Directories

**Problem**: Agent is listed in `.kittify/config.yaml` but directory doesn't exist.

**Cause**: Directory was manually deleted, or filesystem corruption.

**Solution**:

```bash
# Option 1: Restore missing directory
spec-kitty agent config sync --create-missing

# Option 2: Remove from configuration if you don't use it
spec-kitty agent config remove gemini
```

**Detection**: Run `spec-kitty agent config status` - missing agents show yellow "Missing" status.

### Corrupt or Missing config.yaml

**Problem**: `.kittify/config.yaml` is missing, unreadable, or has invalid YAML syntax.

**Symptoms**: Commands fail with YAML parsing errors, or all 12 agents are treated as configured (legacy fallback).

**Solution**:

```bash
# Check current config structure
cat .kittify/config.yaml

# If corrupt or missing, recreate with desired agents
spec-kitty agent config add claude codex opencode
# This recreates config.yaml with only specified agents
```

**Prevention**: Don't manually edit `.kittify/config.yaml` - use `spec-kitty agent config` commands instead.

### "spec-kitty: command not found"

**Problem**: Terminal doesn't recognize `spec-kitty` command.

**Cause**: spec-kitty is not installed or not in PATH.

**Solution**: Ensure spec-kitty is installed via `pip install spec-kitty-cli` and your shell's PATH includes Python package binaries.

**Not a configuration issue**: This is an installation problem. See [Installation Guide](install-spec-kitty.md).

### "Invalid agent keys" Error

**Problem**: You get an error like "Invalid agent keys: cluade" when running `add` or `remove`.

**Cause**: Typo in agent key name.

**Solution**: Check the error message for the list of valid agent keys, and correct your command:

```bash
# Error message shows:
# Valid agent keys:
#   claude, codex, gemini, cursor, qwen, opencode,
#   windsurf, kilocode, roo, copilot, auggie, q

# Fix typo and retry
spec-kitty agent config add claude  # Not "cluade"
```

**Reference**: See [Agent Directory Mappings](#agent-directory-mappings) table for complete list.
