# Known Current Friction Points

> **This page is deliberately time-sensitive and drifts fast.** It captures
> repo and tooling friction that a maintainer — or an agent acting in a
> maintainer capacity — is likely to hit while running a mission *today*. It is
> **not** durable doctrine: specific issue numbers, version gates, and toggles
> change as the codebase moves. Always re-verify against the authoritative
> sources before trusting a specific number:
> [`CLAUDE.md`](../../../AGENTS.md) (its "Test-run baseline-red gotcha" note),
> [ADR 2026-07-17-1](../../adr/3.x/2026-07-17-1-red-main-is-honest-ci-is-release-authority.md),
> and the issue tracker.

**Snapshot date: 2026-08-15 · Spec Kitty 3.2.x.** Proof that this list drifts:
`#2772` was a known-red P0 when this note was first drafted and has since been
closed — so the "known reds" below are already a different set than a month ago.

## The friction points

- **`main` may be legitimately RED.** Honest P0 reproductions are left red on
  purpose ([ADR 2026-07-17-1](../../adr/3.x/2026-07-17-1-red-main-is-honest-ci-is-release-authority.md));
  currently open examples: **#2736**, **#1834**. Before "fixing" any red,
  **attribute** it — reproduce on `upstream/main` / the merge-base. Never
  green-wash a `@pytest.mark.regression` red; that erases a deliberate
  release-blocker signal.
- **CI-environment false reds that pass locally:** auth
  (`logged_out_on_connected_teamspace`) and the sync toggles
  (`SPEC_KITTY_SYNC_MINIMAL_IMPORT` / `SPEC_KITTY_SYNC_DISABLE`, which also skip
  the pre-review gate). Config, not your diff.
- **Stale-install false reds.** Commands that shell out to `spec-kitty` (e.g.
  the `merge-driver-*` commands) only reflect your working tree after
  `pip install -e .` / `uv pip install -e .`. Re-install after every rebase.
- **The `pr:deferred` / `pr:skip-ci` labels skip nearly every required PR
  workflow — a green check can mean "not run," not "passed."** Most
  `.github/workflows/*.yml` job `if:` conditions include
  `!contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'pr:deferred') &&
  !contains(..., 'pr:skip-ci')` (`ci-quality.yml`,
  `doctrine-charter-tests.yml`, `ci-windows.yml`, `docs-freshness.yml`,
  `ui-e2e.yml`, `canonical-producer-lint.yml`, `plugin-validate.yml`,
  `orchestrator-boundary.yml`, `drift-detector.yml`,
  `check-spec-kitty-events-alignment.yml`, and more). Either label makes those
  jobs report **skipped**, not passed. Check the PR's label list before
  treating an all-green run as evidence the change is safe; a skipped job is
  unverified, not clean. (See [pr-landing.md §4](../how-to/pr-landing.md) for
  how to classify checks once you *do* have real CI results to read.)
- **`charter lint`'s project-DRG input (`.kittify/doctrine/graph.yaml`) looks
  gitignored but is deliberately un-ignored — confirm it is tracked and
  in-diff before filing a lint finding.** `.gitignore` blanket-excludes
  `.kittify/doctrine/**` and then re-includes specific subpaths, including
  `!.kittify/doctrine/graph.yaml`; the file is meant to be committed and is
  the first candidate `charter_runtime/lint/_drg.py::_load_project_drg`
  reads (ahead of `merged_drg.json` / `drg.json` / `compiled_drg.json`). If
  it is stale or absent, `charter lint` silently falls back to
  `GraphState.BUILT_IN_ONLY` (or `MISSING`) and skips project-layer checks
  rather than failing loudly — so before treating a `charter lint` result as
  authoritative, confirm `git ls-files .kittify/doctrine/graph.yaml` shows it
  tracked and that `spec-kitty charter synthesize` regenerated it in your
  diff if doctrine artifacts changed.
- **Real-port / daemon tests are not HOME-isolated** (ports 9400–9449). Run them
  serially with `-n0`. Leaked daemons from a prior run squat those ports and fail
  singleton/reaping tests (`test_issue_1071_*`) with a "got 2 ports" assertion —
  that is environmental, not your change. Check `ss -ltnp | grep 94` if a daemon
  test flaps.
- **In a lane or clone, a bare `python` / `pytest` imports the PRIMARY `src`, not
  your lane.** Always `uv run <cmd>`.
- **CI-only gates that pass locally then fail ~40 minutes later:** the
  terminology guard, the architectural shards
  (`integration-tests-core-misc (architectural)`, `arch-adversarial`),
  `canonical-producer-lint` (CP001 fires on a hand-rolled event dict with
  `event_type`+`payload` keys — build via `spec_kitty_events.lifecycle.*`
  instead), and `docs-freshness`. Run `tests/architectural/`, the terminology
  guard, and `PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/docs/check_docs_freshness.py --ci`
  locally on the **rebased** tip before declaring a branch green.
- **The status daemon can auto-commit your staged files** with the *previous*
  mission's commit message. Commit promptly; do not leave a dirty index while it
  runs.
- **No `git stash` in lane worktrees** — the stash stack is shared across
  worktrees, so a `pop` can steal a sibling lane's work-in-progress.
- **`move-task` can hang on sync-daemon fan-out.** Background it and set
  `SPEC_KITTY_SYNC_MINIMAL_IMPORT=1`.
- **After `finalize-tasks`, verify the issue-matrix / coordination state.** 3.2.6
  made the PRIMARY scaffolder idempotent; the coord/merge reset path is not fully
  verified.
- **Docs scripts need `PYTHONPATH=.`**, and `build_cli_reference.py` defaults to
  the *wrong* output path — pass `--output docs/api/cli-commands.md
  --agent-output docs/api/agent-subcommands.md` explicitly.
- **Shared-package boundary:** anchor new runtime code in
  `src/runtime/next/_internal_runtime/`; `src/specify_cli/next/` is a shim
  removed in 3.3.0. Consume events / tracker only via `spec_kitty_events.*` /
  `spec_kitty_tracker.*`.
- **A pyenv-scoped editable `spec-kitty-cli` install shadows a pipx install.**
  Recurring: if `pyenv` manages the Python version active for this repo (a
  `.python-version` file, or `pyenv local`), an editable install left in that
  pyenv version's `site-packages` (an `_editable_impl_spec_kitty_cli.pth`
  pointing at some checkout's `src/`) resolves ahead of the pipx-installed
  `spec-kitty` on `PATH`, so the CLI silently runs a stale or unrelated
  checkout instead of the one you are working in. Detect:
  `which spec-kitty` (a pyenv shim, e.g. `~/.pyenv/shims/spec-kitty`, instead
  of the pipx shim under `~/.local/bin`) and `pip show -f spec-kitty-cli` in
  that pyenv version (an `_editable_impl_spec_kitty_cli.pth` / editable
  project-location entry is the tell). Fix: `pip uninstall spec-kitty-cli`
  inside the offending pyenv version, or reorder `PATH` so the pipx shim wins.
- **`.git/hooks/pre-commit` pins an absolute python interpreter.** The
  commit-guard hook Spec Kitty installs (`specify_cli.policy.hook_installer`)
  captures `sys.executable` at install time and hardcodes it into the hook —
  by design, so the hook does not depend on `PATH` (FR-009). Moving,
  deleting, or rebuilding `.venv` at a different location (a renamed clone, a
  relocated checkout) leaves the pinned path dangling. Symptom: `git commit`
  fails because the hook's interpreter path no longer exists. Fix: if only
  the interpreter binary vanished, `uv sync --frozen --all-extras` rebuilds
  `.venv` at the same path and the existing hook resolves again; if the
  checkout itself moved, delete `.git/hooks/pre-commit` and re-run
  `spec-kitty implement <any-WP>` (or any path that allocates a lane
  worktree) to regenerate the hook pinned to the new location.

## Maintaining this page

When you hit a new mid-mission friction point — or when one above stops being
true (a known-red P0 closes, a toggle is retired, a version gate passes) —
update this page and bump the snapshot date in the same change. Keep entries
short and actionable; deep rationale belongs in the linked runbooks, not here.
