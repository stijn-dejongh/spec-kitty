# Kanban Workflow Explained

Spec Kitty uses a kanban-style workflow to track work package progress. This document explains how lanes work, why we track status this way, and what happens when work moves between lanes.

## The Nine Lanes

Work packages move through nine lanes during their lifecycle. Seven lanes form the main progression, and two lanes handle exceptional states:

### Main progression

```
planned -> claimed -> in_progress -> for_review -> in_review -> approved -> done
```

### Exceptional states

```
blocked    (reachable from planned, claimed, in_progress, for_review, in_review, approved)
canceled   (reachable from planned, claimed, in_progress, for_review, in_review, approved, blocked)
```

### Lane definitions

#### planned

**Meaning**: Work package is defined and ready to start.

**How it gets here**:
- `/spec-kitty.tasks` creates WPs in `planned` lane
- Returned from review with feedback (`for_review -> planned`, `approved -> planned`)
- Voluntarily un-claimed (`in_progress -> planned`, with reason required)

**What happens**:
- WP waits for an agent to claim it
- Dependencies are satisfied (or WP is independent)

#### claimed

**Meaning**: An agent has claimed this work package but has not yet started a workspace.

**How it gets here**:
- Agent claims WP with `spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP01 --to doing --assignee claude`
- Guard: requires actor identity

**What happens**:
- WP is reserved for the claiming agent
- No workspace exists yet
- Next step: create a workspace and transition to `in_progress`

#### in_progress

**Meaning**: An agent is actively implementing this work package in a workspace.

**How it gets here**:
- From `claimed` when a workspace is created (`claimed -> in_progress`)
- Automatically when running `spec-kitty agent action implement WP01 --agent <name>`
- Returned from review/approval for rework (`for_review -> in_progress`, `approved -> in_progress`)
- Unblocked (`blocked -> in_progress`)
- Guard: `claimed -> in_progress` requires workspace context

**What happens**:
- Agent works in the WP's worktree
- Makes commits to the lane branch backing the current workspace
- Only ONE agent should have a WP in `in_progress` at a time

**Alias**: `doing` is accepted as input and resolved to `in_progress` at input boundaries. The alias is never persisted in events or frontmatter.

#### for_review

**Meaning**: Implementation is complete, waiting for review.

**How it gets here**:
- Agent moves WP with `spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP01 --to for_review`
- Guard: requires completed subtasks and implementation evidence (or `--force`)

**What happens**:
- WP waits in the review queue
- A reviewer claims it by transitioning `for_review -> in_review`
- Can also be blocked (`-> blocked`) or canceled (`-> canceled`)

#### in_review

**Meaning**: A reviewer is actively examining this work package.

**How it gets here**:
- Reviewer claims WP from review queue: `for_review -> in_review`
- Guard: requires actor identity (conflict detection prevents two reviewers claiming the same WP)

**What happens**:
- Reviewer examines the implementation against spec and acceptance criteria
- All outbound transitions require a `ReviewResult` in the transition context
- Either approves (`-> approved`) or requests changes (`-> in_progress` or `-> planned` with feedback)
- Can also be blocked (`-> blocked`) or canceled (`-> canceled`)

#### approved

**Meaning**: Work package has passed review and is merge-pending.

**How it gets here**:
- Reviewer approves: `spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP01 --to approved --approval-ref PR#42`
- Can come from `for_review` or directly from `in_progress` (skipping explicit review)
- Guard: requires reviewer approval evidence (reviewer identity + approval reference)

**What happens**:
- WP is approved and ready for acceptance and merge
- Can still be sent back for rework if issues arise (`-> in_progress` or `-> planned`)

#### done

**Meaning**: Work package has been merged/integrated into the mission target branch.

**How it gets here**:
- From `approved` after merge/integration, or via forced override with audit evidence
- Guard: requires merge/integration evidence or an explicit force reason

**What happens**:
- Lane branch content has already landed
- No further changes expected
- `approved` unblocks dependent WPs immediately
- `done` is recorded by merge bookkeeping after approved work lands
- Once all WPs are `approved` or `done`, run `/spec-kitty.accept` to validate
  the entire mission before merge

#### blocked

**Meaning**: Work package cannot proceed due to an external dependency or issue.

**How it gets here**:
- Any non-terminal lane can transition to `blocked` (planned, claimed, in_progress, for_review, in_review, approved)

**What happens**:
- WP is parked until the blocker is resolved
- Can transition to `in_progress` when unblocked
- Can be canceled if the blocker is permanent

#### canceled

**Meaning**: Work package has been abandoned and will not be completed.

**How it gets here**:
- Any non-done lane can transition to `canceled` (planned, claimed, in_progress, for_review, in_review, approved, blocked)

**What happens**:
- WP is removed from active work
- `canceled` is a terminal lane (force required to leave)
- Does not count toward feature completion

## Allowed Transitions (27 pairs)

The state machine enforces exactly 27 legal transitions. Any transition not in this list is rejected unless `--force` is used (which requires actor + reason for audit).

### Forward progression (8)

| From | To | Guard |
|------|----|-------|
| planned | claimed | Actor identity required |
| claimed | in_progress | Workspace context required |
| in_progress | for_review | Subtasks complete + evidence (or force) |
| for_review | in_review | Actor identity required (conflict detection) |
| in_review | approved | ReviewResult required |
| in_review | done | Legacy direct-completion path; prefer in_review -> approved, then merge records done |
| in_progress | approved | Reviewer approval evidence |
| approved | done | Merge/integration evidence |

### Rework / rollback (5)

| From | To | Guard |
|------|----|-------|
| in_review | in_progress | ReviewResult required |
| in_review | planned | ReviewResult required |
| approved | in_progress | Review reference required |
| approved | planned | Review reference required |
| in_progress | planned | Reason required |

### Blocking (7)

| From | To | Guard |
|------|----|-------|
| planned | blocked | (none) |
| claimed | blocked | (none) |
| in_progress | blocked | (none) |
| for_review | blocked | (none) |
| in_review | blocked | ReviewResult required |
| approved | blocked | (none) |
| blocked | in_progress | (none) |

### Cancellation (7)

| From | To | Guard |
|------|----|-------|
| planned | canceled | (none) |
| claimed | canceled | (none) |
| in_progress | canceled | (none) |
| for_review | canceled | (none) |
| in_review | canceled | ReviewResult required |
| approved | canceled | (none) |
| blocked | canceled | (none) |

### Force overrides

Any transition not in the 27 allowed pairs can still be performed with `--force`, which requires both `actor` and `reason`. Force also bypasses guard conditions on allowed transitions. This is designed for administrative recovery, not normal workflow.

### Terminal lanes

`done` and `canceled` are terminal. Transitioning out of a terminal lane requires `--force` with actor + reason.

## How Work Moves Between Lanes

### Normal Flow: planned -> claimed -> in_progress -> for_review -> in_review -> approved -> done

```
1. WP created by /spec-kitty.tasks
   lane: planned

2. Agent claims WP
   spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP01 --to doing --assignee claude
   lane: claimed (resolved from "doing" alias at input, but actual transition is planned -> claimed)

3. Agent creates workspace
   spec-kitty agent action implement WP01 --agent <name>
   lane: in_progress

4. Agent completes implementation
   spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP01 --to for_review
   lane: for_review

5. Reviewer claims WP for review
   spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP01 --to in_review --assignee reviewer
   lane: in_review

6. Reviewer approves
   spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP01 --to approved --approval-ref PR#42
   lane: approved

7. Continue until every WP is approved or done
   (Then /spec-kitty.accept validates the mission before merge)
```

### Review Feedback: in_review -> planned (with feedback)

When review finds issues:

```
1. WP in for_review, reviewer claims it
   spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP01 --to in_review --assignee reviewer
   lane: in_review

2. Reviewer finds problems
   /spec-kitty.review WP01
   Writes feedback file and runs move-task with --review-feedback-file
   Feedback persisted to git common-dir as feedback://<feature>/<wp>/<artifact>.md
   lane: planned (reset)
   review_status: has_feedback
   review_feedback: feedback://<feature>/<wp>/<artifact>.md

3. Agent re-claims WP
   Reads review_feedback pointer from frontmatter
   Addresses issues
   lane: claimed -> in_progress -> for_review

4. Reviewer re-reviews (claims again: for_review -> in_review)
   If good: lane: in_review -> approved
   If issues remain: repeat
```

### Blocking and Unblocking

```
1. WP hits an external blocker
   spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP01 --to blocked --note "Waiting for API key"
   lane: blocked

2. Blocker resolved
   spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP01 --to in_progress
   lane: in_progress (resumes work)
```

## Event Log (Canonical Status Tracking)

Lane transitions are tracked in an append-only event log stored at `kitty-specs/<feature>/status.events.jsonl`. Each line is a JSON object representing one `StatusEvent`:

```json
{"actor":"claude","at":"2026-02-08T12:00:00+00:00","event_id":"01HXYZ...","evidence":null,"execution_mode":"worktree","feature_slug":"034-feature","force":false,"from_lane":"planned","reason":null,"review_ref":null,"to_lane":"claimed","wp_id":"WP01"}
```

### StatusEvent fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `event_id` | string | ULID (globally unique, time-sortable) |
| `feature_slug` | string | Feature identifier (e.g., "034-feature-name") |
| `wp_id` | string | Work package ID (e.g., "WP01") |
| `from_lane` | string | Lane before transition (canonical name) |
| `to_lane` | string | Lane after transition (canonical name) |
| `at` | string | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp |
| `actor` | string | Who made the transition (agent name or "system") |
| `force` | boolean | Whether force override was used |
| `execution_mode` | string | "worktree" or "direct_repo" |
| `reason` | string/null | Reason for forced or rollback transitions |
| `review_ref` | string/null | Review feedback reference |
| `evidence` | object/null | DoneEvidence payload (for done transitions) |

### Why an event log?

**Immutability**: Events are append-only. No event is ever modified or deleted.

**Deterministic replay**: The `reduce()` function replays all events to produce a `StatusSnapshot` (materialized as `status.json`). Same events always produce the same snapshot.

**Debugging**: If something goes wrong, you can trace the full history of transitions.

**Metrics**: Calculate time-in-lane, cycle time, throughput from the event stream.

**Audit trail**: Know who did what, when, and why.

**Coordination**: Multiple agents can see what others are doing.

### Materialization

The current state of all WPs is derived from the event log by the deterministic reducer:

```bash
spec-kitty agent status materialize
```

This produces `status.json` (the `StatusSnapshot`), which contains the current lane, actor, and timestamp for every WP.

## Lane Status in Frontmatter

Lane status is also reflected in each work package's YAML frontmatter for backward compatibility:

```yaml
---
work_package_id: "WP01"
title: "Database Schema"
lane: "in_progress"
assignee: "claude"
agent: "claude"
shell_pid: "12345"
review_status: ""
review_feedback: ""
---
```

### Key Fields

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `lane` | Current status (canonical lane name) |
| `assignee` | Who is working on this WP |
| `agent` | Which AI agent claimed this |
| `shell_pid` | Process ID of the agent (for tracking) |
| `review_status` | Empty or `has_feedback` if returned from review |
| `review_feedback` | Pointer to persisted feedback artifact (`feedback://...`) |

### Not Directories, Just a Field

In many kanban systems, you move cards between columns (directories). In Spec Kitty, the WP file stays in the same place -- only the `lane:` field changes.

```
kitty-specs/012-feature/tasks/
  WP01-database.md      # lane: done
  WP02-api.md           # lane: for_review
  WP03-frontend.md      # lane: in_progress
  WP04-tests.md         # lane: planned
```

This design keeps all WP files in one location for easier discovery.

## Kanban Board Display

### CLI board (`spec-kitty agent tasks status`)

The CLI status command displays a **5-column** kanban board:

```
Feature: 012-user-authentication
Kanban Board
  Planned       Doing         For Review    In Review     Approved      Done
  WP04-tests    WP03-front..  WP02-api      WP06-auth     WP05-docs     WP01-database
                (stale: 15m)

  1 WPs         1 WPs         1 WPs         1 WPs         1 WPs         1 WPs
Progress: 1/6 (16.7%)
```

The display maps the 9 internal lanes to 6 board columns:

| Display Column | Internal Lane(s) |
|----------------|------------------|
| Planned | `planned` |
| Doing | `claimed`, `in_progress` (`claimed` is active ownership; `in_progress` is active implementation) |
| For Review | `for_review` |
| In Review | `in_review` (active review in progress) |
| Approved | `approved` |
| Done | `done` |

`blocked` and `canceled` WPs are not shown in the main board columns. They appear in separate sections below the board when present.

### Python API board (`agent_utils/status.py`)

The Python API (`show_kanban_status()`) displays all 9 lanes as separate columns, giving full visibility into every state.

## Who Moves Work?

### Agents Move Work Forward

Agents are responsible for:
- `planned -> claimed` (or `doing` alias) - Claiming a WP to work on
- `claimed -> in_progress` - Starting work in a workspace
- `in_progress -> for_review` - Signaling completion

Commands:
```bash
# Claim a WP
spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP01 --to doing --assignee claude

# Mark complete
spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP01 --to for_review --note "Implementation complete"
```

### Reviewers Make Accept/Reject Decisions

Reviewers are responsible for:
- `for_review -> in_review` - Claiming a WP for active review
- `in_review -> approved` - Approving work (requires ReviewResult)
- `in_review -> planned` - Requesting changes with feedback (requires ReviewResult)
- `in_review -> in_progress` - Requesting minor changes, keeps workspace (requires ReviewResult)

Merge is responsible for `approved -> done` after integration.

Commands:
```bash
# Claim a WP for review (for_review -> in_review)
spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP01 --to in_review --assignee reviewer

# Review a WP (opens review workflow)
/spec-kitty.review WP01

# Approve (in_review -> approved)
spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP01 --to approved --approval-ref PR#42

# Request changes with feedback file (in_review -> planned)
spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP01 --to planned --review-feedback-file feedback.md

# Once ALL WPs are approved or done, validate the mission before merge
/spec-kitty.accept
```

### Users and External Orchestrators Can Override

Users can override lane transitions when needed:
```bash
# Force move (e.g., to un-block stuck work or leave a terminal lane)
spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP01 --to planned --force --note "Reopening after hotfix"
```

External orchestrators should request equivalent transitions through `spec-kitty orchestrator-api transition ...`, including review-handoff evidence such as `--subtasks-complete`, `--implementation-evidence-present`, `--review-ref`, and `--evidence-json`, so host validation and audit history stay consistent.

## Rules and Constraints

### One Agent Per WP in Progress

When a WP is in `claimed` or `in_progress`:
- Only the assigned agent should work on it
- Other agents should work on different WPs
- This prevents conflicts and wasted work

### Dependencies Must Be Satisfied

Before moving a WP to `claimed` or `in_progress`:
- All dependencies must be in `done` lane (or at least `for_review`)
- If WP02 depends on WP01, WP01 should be complete first

The implement command enforces this:
```bash
spec-kitty agent action implement WP02 --agent <name>  # Ensures WP01 code is available
```

### Review Before Done

WPs cannot skip directly from `in_progress` to `done`:
- Must pass through `for_review`, `in_review`, and `approved` first
- Review approval records `approved`; merge/integration records `done`
- This ensures all work is validated before it lands

### Subtask Validation

Before moving to `for_review`:
- All subtasks in the WP must be marked `[x]`
- The system blocks moves if subtasks are unchecked (unless `--force` is used)
- Ensures nothing is forgotten

## Common Patterns

### Linear Workflow

```
WP01 -> WP02 -> WP03 -> WP04
```

Each WP moves through lanes sequentially. One agent handles everything.

### Parallel Workflow

```
        WP01 (done)
       /    \
WP02 (in_progress)  WP03 (in_progress)
```

Multiple WPs in `in_progress` simultaneously. Different agents work in parallel.

### Review Feedback Loop

```
planned -> claimed -> in_progress -> for_review -> in_review -> planned -> claimed -> in_progress -> for_review -> in_review -> approved -> done
                                                       ^                                                           ^
                                                  (feedback)                                                  (approved)
```

Work returned from review goes back to `planned` with feedback.

### Blocking Pattern

```
planned -> claimed -> in_progress -> blocked -> in_progress -> for_review -> approved -> done
                                        ^            ^
                                   (blocker)    (unblocked)
```

Work paused due to external dependency, then resumed.
