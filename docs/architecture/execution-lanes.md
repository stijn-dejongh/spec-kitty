# Execution Lanes

Spec Kitty uses a lane-based execution model.

- `finalize_tasks` computes `lanes.json` from dependencies, ownership, and predicted surfaces.
- Each lane gets exactly one git worktree and one lane branch.
- Sequential work packages in the same lane reuse that same worktree.
- Independent lanes can run in parallel in separate worktrees.

## Core Rules

1. Planning happens in the primary repository checkout.
2. `spec-kitty agent action implement WP## --agent <name>` requires a valid `lanes.json`.
3. The runtime chooses the lane worktree. Agents do not pick a base branch manually.
4. If a feature computes one lane, the feature uses one worktree.
5. Merge always follows `lane branches -> mission branch -> target branch`.

## Workspace Resolution Contract

`spec-kitty implement WP##` creates/reuses the execution workspace through
`resolve_workspace_for_wp` (`src/specify_cli/workspace/context.py`). For a
`code_change` WP, resolution ends at one of two places:

1. An **existing** lane workspace context (`find_context_for_wp`) — the lane
   this WP's mission already allocated a worktree for.
2. Otherwise, the mapping in `lanes.json`, read through
   `require_lanes_json` (`src/specify_cli/lanes/persistence.py`).

`require_lanes_json` is fail-closed: when `lanes.json` is absent it raises
`MissingLanesError` rather than degrading to a name-guessed path. **There is
no `-WP##` legacy worktree fallback** — flat, `SINGLE_BRANCH`, and `LANES`
missions all still require a computed `lanes.json`; a mission that hasn't run
`finalize-tasks` cannot resolve a workspace at all. (An earlier revision of
this repo's `AGENTS.md` claimed such a fallback existed; that claim was
false and has been corrected — see the `MissingLanesError` contract above
for the real behavior.)

## Naming

As of mission `083-mission-id-canonical-identity-migration`, every mission carries a ULID
identity (`mission_id`), and branch and worktree names embed the first 8 characters of
that ULID (`mid8`) to guarantee collision-free naming even when two missions share the
same human slug.

- Mission branch: `kitty/mission-<human-slug>-<mid8>`
- Lane branch: `kitty/mission-<human-slug>-<mid8>-lane-a`
- Lane worktree: `.worktrees/<human-slug>-<mid8>-lane-a/`

Example, for a mission with `mission_slug=my-feature` and
`mission_id=01J6XW9KQT7M0YB3N4R5CQZ2EX` (so `mid8=01J6XW9K`):

- Mission branch: `kitty/mission-my-feature-01J6XW9K`
- Lane branch: `kitty/mission-my-feature-01J6XW9K-lane-a`
- Lane worktree: `.worktrees/my-feature-01J6XW9K-lane-a/`

Legacy (pre-083) forms such as `kitty/mission-001-my-feature-lane-a` and
`.worktrees/001-my-feature-lane-a/` remain readable by current tooling but
are no longer the form produced by `implement`. Upgrade via the
[mission identity migration runbook](../migrations/mission-id-canonical-identity.md).

## Why This Replaced Per-WP Worktrees

Per-work-package worktrees allowed overlapping work packages to run in parallel and collide at merge time. Execution lanes eliminate that by forcing dependent or overlapping work packages into the same lane, branch, and worktree.

## Parallelism Preservation

`finalize-tasks` assigns WPs to lanes based on two criteria:

1. **File ownership overlap** — WPs that declare no files in common are placed in separate lanes and run in parallel.
2. **Explicit dependencies** — If WP B lists WP A in its `dependencies` field, they are assigned to the same lane and run sequentially (A then B).

When neither criterion forces a merge, the pipeline keeps WPs in separate lanes to maximise parallelism. When a merge is forced, it is recorded in `lanes.json` under the `collapse_report` field:

```json
{
  "collapse_report": [
    {
      "merged_wps": ["WP02", "WP03"],
      "reason": "overlapping owned files: src/foo.py"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each entry in `collapse_report` lists the WPs that were merged into a single lane and the reason (file overlap or explicit dependency). Inspect this field after `finalize-tasks` to understand why two WPs share a lane.

### Disjoint Ownership vs. the Surface Heuristic (bulk-edit missions)

`compute_lanes` (`src/specify_cli/lanes/compute.py`) has a second collapse
rule beyond file-overlap: two WPs that share an inferred *surface* keyword
(e.g. both bodies mention "legacy" or "cleanup", matching the
`legacy-cleanup` tag in `SURFACE_TAXONOMY`) are also candidates for merging
into one lane — **unless their `owned_files` are provably disjoint**
(`_are_disjoint`), in which case the merge is skipped.

This matters most for bulk-edit missions (see the [bulk-edit occurrence
classification guardrail
ADR](../adr/3.x/2026-04-14-1-bulk-edit-occurrence-classification-guardrail.md)):
a rename/replace mission routinely produces many WPs whose bodies all
describe the *same* edit applied to *different* files, so they trip the
same surface keyword nearly every time. Without the disjoint-ownership
check, the surface heuristic alone would collapse every one of those WPs
into a single giant lane, discarding the parallel partition the
occurrence-map classification was built to produce. The disjoint check is
what lets bulk-edit WPs with non-overlapping file scopes stay in separate
lanes and run in parallel.

It also keeps the lane dependency graph (`lane_deps`) well-formed. Lane
depth is computed by `_compute_lane_depths`, which treats a self-loop or
cycle as a best-effort depth-0 anchor rather than crashing — see
[`finalize-tasks internals`](../api/finalize-tasks-internals.md#2-lane-depth-cycle-safety)
for why that fallback exists and why it is *not* a substitute for a clean
input graph. An over-aggressive surface-only merge across many
similarly-worded bulk-edit WPs is exactly the kind of input that could
otherwise produce a lane graph the depth function has to paper over instead
of compute correctly; skipping the merge when ownership is disjoint avoids
manufacturing that situation in the first place.

- [Branch-Target Routing](branch-target-routing.md) — where each diff type lands, decided
  per artifact kind (`src/mission_runtime/artifacts.py`): planning + identity artifacts
  (spec, plan, tasks, work-package files, `data-model.md`, `lanes.json`, `meta.json`) go to
  the primary target branch for every topology; coordination-owned artifacts (status events,
  `acceptance-matrix.json`, `issue-matrix.md`, `analysis-report.md`) go to the coordination
  branch; code changes go to the lane branch; shared documentation and the merge target go
  to the base branch. Also explains the simple-case flat-topology collapse when no
  coordination branch or lane worktrees are configured.

## Lane-Specific Test Database Isolation (FR-006)

Two parallel SaaS / Django lanes used to share a single test database when their per-lane test runners booted concurrently, which produced flaky failures. Each lane workspace now exposes a lane-suffixed identifier via `LaneWorkspaceResult.lane_test_env`, which sets `SPEC_KITTY_TEST_DB_NAME=test_<safe-mission>_<safe-lane>`. Test settings modules (Django and otherwise) should read that env var when constructing their per-lane test database name; the helpers `lane_test_db_name()` and `lane_test_env()` in `specify_cli.lanes.lane_env` are the canonical entry points and guarantee distinct DB names for distinct `(mission_slug, lane_id)` pairs.
