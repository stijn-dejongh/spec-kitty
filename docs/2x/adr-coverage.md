# 2.x ADR Coverage

## Audit Summary

A fresh-clone audit compared `architecture/2.x/adr/` against current 2.x code surfaces.

Result:

1. Runtime and status/event areas were already covered by ADRs.
2. Doctrine artifact governance and living glossary architecture were implemented but undocumented.
3. This gap is closed by new ADRs dated `2026-02-23`.
