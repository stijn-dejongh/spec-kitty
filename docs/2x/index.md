# 2.x Documentation (Current Track)

`2.x` is the current architecture track, centered on doctrine-backed governance,
living glossary semantics, and runtime-owned mission execution.

## Key 2.x Shifts

1. Doctrine artifacts are typed and schema-validated under `src/doctrine/`.
2. Constitution generation uses interview answers plus doctrine catalog selection.
3. Glossary is context-owned (`glossary/contexts/*.md`) and integrated into mission execution through glossary hooks.
4. Runtime loop and mission discovery are driven by canonical `next` and runtime precedence rules.

## Start Here

1. [Doctrine and Constitution](doctrine-and-constitution.md)
2. [Glossary System](glossary-system.md)
3. [Runtime and Missions](runtime-and-missions.md)
4. [Orchestration and API Boundary](orchestration-and-api.md)
5. [ADR Coverage](adr-coverage.md)
