# 3.x ADRs

Architectural Decision Records for the 3.x track (starting 3.0.0, released 2026-03-30).

## Naming

- `YYYY-MM-DD-N-descriptive-title-with-dashes.md` where `N` is `1, 2, 3, …` per ADR landed on a given date.

After adding an ADR file, run `python scripts/docs/freshen_adr_inventory.py docs/adr/3.x/<your-adr>.md`
to update the page-inventory lockfile and add the row to the index table below.

## Source of Truth

This folder is canonical for 3.x decisions. The `architecture/` tree was removed
by the Common Docs structural move (PR #2225); existing references using the old
`architecture/2.x/adr/<filename>` paths will need updating to `docs/adr/3.x/`.

## Status Conventions

- `Accepted` means the decision remains current policy.
- `Superseded` means a newer ADR replaced the decision; keep the file for history, but do not implement from it.
- `Deprecated` means the direction is in active retirement and should not receive new work.

## Template

Use the shared template at [`docs/architecture/adr-template.md`](../../architecture/adr-template.md).
