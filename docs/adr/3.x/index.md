# 3.x ADRs

Architectural Decision Records for the 3.x track (starting 3.0.0, released 2026-03-30).

## Era history

The 3.x track formally began with the **3.0.0 release on 2026-03-30**. ADRs dated on or
after that release live here; older decisions remain in [`docs/adr/2.x/`](../2.x/index.md)
and [`docs/adr/1.x/`](../1.x/index.md). A handful of ADRs landed just before the era
restructuring but thematically belong to 3.x — the shared-package-boundary cutover,
mission-identity-uses-ULID, and the retrospective-gate work — and were moved here with
their git history preserved.

The 3.x era is where Spec Kitty's runtime became a **doctrine-governed, charter-activated**
system with a hardened execution model. The through-lines of this era's decisions:

- **Execution lanes, worktrees, and mission branches** — lanes own their worktrees and
  branches; review approval, integration completion, and mission acceptance became
  distinct, and acceptance runs on the integrated mission branch.
- **Mission identity and topology** — ULID-based canonical identity (not a sequential
  prefix), MissionTopology as a single source of truth, and kind-/topology-aware artifact
  placement with read/write surface symmetry.
- **Doctrine offers, charter activates, runtime consumes** — the doctrine → charter → core
  resolution unification, DRG edges as the canonical artefact-relationship authority,
  progressive disclosure of doctrine context, and the glossary promoted to a first-order
  doctrine artefact.
- **Shared package and integration boundaries** — the shared-package-boundary cutover, the
  CORE/INTEGRATION boundary model, single-authority seams, and the consolidated
  write-surface wiring with `consolidate` as the canonical lane-consolidation term.
- **Governance honesty** — red main is honest signal and CI is the release authority;
  charter.yaml is the authoritative structured source with the prose extractor retired.

This is the **current** track. The prior architecture is [2.x](../2.x/index.md); the
foundational decisions are [1.x](../1.x/index.md).

## Naming

- `YYYY-MM-DD-N-descriptive-title-with-dashes.md` where `N` is `1, 2, 3, …` per ADR landed on a given date.

After adding an ADR file, run (from the repository root, so `scripts` resolves as a
package — #3227) `python -m scripts.docs.freshen_adr_inventory docs/adr/3.x/<your-adr>.md`
to update the page-inventory lockfile and add the row to the index table below. Invoking
the script by file path (`python scripts/docs/freshen_adr_inventory.py ...`) fails with
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scripts'`; use the `python -m` module form.

## Source of Truth

This folder is canonical for 3.x decisions. The `architecture/` tree was removed
by the Common Docs structural move (PR #2225); existing references using the old
`architecture/2.x/adr/<filename>` paths will need updating to `docs/adr/3.x/`.

## Status Conventions

- `Accepted` means the decision remains current policy.
- `Superseded` means a newer ADR replaced the decision; keep the file for history, but do not implement from it.
- `Deprecated` means the direction is in active retirement and should not receive new work.

## Template

Use the shared template at [`docs/architecture/adr-template.md`](../../architecture/adr-template.md).
